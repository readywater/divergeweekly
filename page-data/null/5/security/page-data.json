Whereas China is taking the official stance that there are no active infections in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the US military is being both open and proactive in engaging with the threat. Unfortunately, the nature of military service is close proximity and frequent rotations, so it is inevitable that a substantive portion of the uniformed service of both countries will be infected."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The way this virus is reshaping our security landscape and relative strength is important to watch. With the US military reeling from nearly two decades of war, the sudden reality that the homeland is no sanctuary may come as a lasting shock. By the same token, just as President Xi was dealt a major political blow when his administration failed to cover up the Wuhan outbreak, President Trump is facing the same for his unwillingness and inability to enact any meaningful preparation as the chief executive. With that, both leaders have now turned to blaming the others for what is effectively a risk that was inevitable: whether it emerged from a Chinese wet market, an American farm, a Brazilian forestry site, or an African mining operation. These cycles of blame and escalation are incredibly dangerous, and it’s these types of cycles and feedback loops which we need to watch as closely as the immediate effects of our current pandemic and economic crisis."}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"fields":{"slug":"/5/security/","readingTime":{"minutes":1.33,"words":266}},"frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null,"description":null,"issue":null,"tags":null,"category":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/5/security/","previous":{"id":"9bc06eb4-bf0e-5db2-8f51-61c5593a5e3d","fields":{"slug":"/5/jobs/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"","category":null,"tags":null}},"next":{"id":"929afbd5-98ff-5fd8-a89f-fdad079455d5","fields":{"slug":"/5/region/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"","category":null,"tags":null}}}}}
