The chipping away by populism and religious violence, the world’s largest democracy is straining under multiple stressors, and covid-19 is only the most recent. Looking at the anti-muslim rhetoric of the Modi administration, it is a major worry that this crisis will turn into a justification for increased surveillance and increased persecution. While many world leaders are finding their position tenuous in these times, most authoritarians will leverage emergency power in the coming weeks, months, and years to secure their position. The question is: can that impulse be controlled by democratic institutions and civil society?"}]}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block","region"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block-heading"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Americas"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block-body"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-states-peak-hospitals-53274e0e-69b8-4dc7-b069-fb27955c559a.html"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The coronavirus outbreak won’t peak in every state at once"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe last two issues of Diverge looked at this idea that a common event in time is experienced both subjectively and objectively in very different ways. In this case, we have an incredibly tangible model of how covid-19 will hit its peak in different states, at different points in time. As we saw in the UK (PM Johnson went from recommended herd immunity and handshaking the infected to self isolating) and an unending stream of exponential graphs, that interval between a considered-or-ignored threat and a deadly reality comes far too quickly."}]}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block","region"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block-heading"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"MENA"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block-body"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/3/31/europe-sends-medical-gear-to-iran-in-sanction-bypass-deal"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Europe sends medical gear to Iran, bypassing US sanctions as coronavirus deaths rise"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\nCycles can also be productive. The crippling (and unfortunately fairly innovative) sanctions placed on Iran by the United States are a substantive contributor to the current scale of the covid-19 crisis in Iran. While certainly not the only factor (Iranian government collectively showed up to work with a temperature of 45c and the statement “I feel fine. Is it hot in here?” on their lips), this push against the US sanction regime through a (somewhat) new transaction mode called INSTEX may serve not only as a diplomatic reset with Iran, but as an absolutely vital measure to save Iranian lives."}]}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block","region"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block-heading"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Africa"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block-body"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/somalia-sending-20-doctors-to-help-italy-fight-virus/1782154"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Somalia sending 20 doctors to help Italy fight virus"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\nIn a world of deep but variate mutual dependence, we should watch for the cycles of stasis or change around the world. African nations are responding to the crisis in different ways and keeping an eye to the shifting power structures between the US and China, partially by pushing against the tired stereotype of being only recipients of aid rather than active participants in a global community. Because our experience of now is by definition only fodder for future iteration, these power dynamics and responses paint a picture of where we’ll be tomorrow."}]}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block","region"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block-heading"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Europe"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block-body"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/28644/has-the-world-learned-the-lessons-of-the-2015-refugee-crisis"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Has the World Learned the Lessons of the 2015 Refugee Crisis?"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\nFramed by the current coronavirus crisis, this article explores the collective action problem of mass migration and what we have apparently failed to learn in its systemic effects. As Dona Meadows demonstrates, while events may differ on the surface, their underlying systemic mechanics might actually be quite similar. I found this to be a useful read given how the European Union has been approaching the virus and its most affected member states, both to consider consistencies in response and in how this virus will multiply the strain already felt by the EU."}]}]}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"fields":{"slug":"/5/region/","readingTime":{"minutes":3.085,"words":617}},"frontmatter":{"title":"","date":null,"description":null,"issue":null,"tags":null,"category":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/5/region/","previous":{"id":"6cb77339-b1ec-57fb-a0da-2d810c4f3f64","fields":{"slug":"/5/security/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"","category":null,"tags":null}},"next":null}}}
