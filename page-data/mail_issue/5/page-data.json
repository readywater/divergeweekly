A central argument is that infectious disease must be reframed as a vital security issue — internationally, regionally, domestically — in order to both prepare as we do for militarized conflict, and to appropriately leverage alliances is combatting a spreading infection. By securitizing the disease (yes, securitize is a word, at least as far as the Copenhagen school is concerned), the scope of potential actions and outcomes changes.

I’ll admit that my biggest long-term fear with Covid-19 is that resilience within our systems will be consistently weaker, simply because we don’t know when a wave of infection might hit critical personnel, or we have to limit response size to balance risk and capacity for healthcare providers.
