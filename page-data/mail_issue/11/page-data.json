Through its hierarchal structure, the education of its officer corps, and the dispositional towards historical awareness of its members, I’d argue that it has symbolically and actually greater power than American federalism allows outside of the federal armed forces. With the role that the military plays as an employer and opportunity-creator for millions of Americans (there are currently 18 million veterans in the US), that change in who is celebrated in bases, statues, ship names, and heroics has the potential to create an enduring impact and perhaps shorten the wait for some kind of healing."}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"jobs","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block","jobad"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block-heading"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Global UX for final inclusion"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{"className":["custom-block-body"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"a","properties":{"href":"https://jobs-accion.icims.com/jobs/2074/consultant---ui-ux-designer/job?mobile=false&width=1333&height=500&bga=true&needsRedirect=false&jan1offset=60&jun1offset=120"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"UX Designer, Accion"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\nLocated in Latin America and India"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This looks like a pretty rad UX role in an impactful non-profit focused on financial inclusion.
