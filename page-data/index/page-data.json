A central argument is that infectious disease must be reframed as a vital security issue — internationally, regionally, domestically — in order to both prepare as we do for militarized conflict, and to appropriately leverage alliances is combatting a spreading infection. By securitizing the disease (yes, securitize is a word, at least as far as the Copenhagen school is concerned), the scope of potential actions and outcomes changes.

I’ll admit that my biggest long-term fear with Covid-19 is that resilience within our systems will be consistently weaker, simply because we don’t know when a wave of infection might hit critical personnel, or we have to limit response size to balance risk and capacity for healthcare providers.

It has a sustainable and profitable business model that isn’t extractive to its customer base, and vitally, the value system of its designer Andreas aligns brilliantly with the value his customers receive from the product. But Alexander has been working on this thing for years. The product emerged from his masters in industrial design, and before that, he had spent time in Kenya working and volunteering. The product itself was vitally co-designed with its users: with Alexander taking multiple extended trips across Africa to work with his potential customers.

Access to capital, development projects, education, and political enfranchisement are certainly great things on the surface, but on what terms? And for whom? In his 2013 article Money Pit, Joel Brinkley recounts examples of failures from the US development in Afghanistan. As the US DOD Government Accountability Office put it, “we noted that without an adequate number of trained oversight personnel, DoD could not be assured that contractors could meet contract requirements efficiently and effectively.” This resulted in such memorable mistakes as a dining hall without a kitchen, a shower facility without plumbing, and a forward operating base built so flimsily, its staircases were a greater threat to US personnel than the Taliban."}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The issue of oversight in this case is "},{"type":"element","tagName":"strong","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"a failure to receive feedback from ones market"}]},{"type":"text","value":".

The stock market, for example, is believed to be an invaluable aggregator of sentiment and mood within an economy. By the same token, the synthesis of a dozen users interviewed is believed to be a vital aggregation of your customer’s needs and intent. Across the myriad ways that the US aid program in Afghanistan differed from the Marshall plan, those feedback mechanisms are primary. Without effective feedback, how could the US government and its many agencies possibly get to a model of development that reflected the real needs of the Afghan people?
