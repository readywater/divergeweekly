Design practice has a deep capacity to reveal the unseen and to affect our behaviour, the systems we rely on, and the outcomes we
collectively experience. 

Diverge Weekly takes a critical global perspective in how design emerges from different localities, and how our design decisions
converge to impact and influence the lives of those around the world.
