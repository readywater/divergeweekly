Image credit: Mikhael SubotzkyHi all,

We’re going to try something a little bit different this week and reflect a bit about this project and its goals. This is issue #5
(including a prototype issue 0 which no one saw), so it felt like time to take stock.

WHAT IS THIS NEWSLETTER?
I’m still trying to figure out what this newsletter is meant to be and where its identity lies. The current subtitle of the site
is: Every Wednesday, a look at design and designers through the lens of global affairs to inform, inspire, and activate. This
tagline is going to change a fair bit as the site changes, of course, but it does do a good job addressing what I want to
accomplish:

 1. To use design practice and discourse as a lens to engage with global affairs — from conflicts, to supply chains, to our
    current global pandemic. I’m also trying to focus on the work of design, asking what products, services, insights, and
    experiences are generated through design practice and where we are seeing that in international events.
 2. To funnel critical international relations theory and practice INTO the domain of design practice. I’m currently doing a
    masters in International Security Studies, so this is very much something I’m discovering. I’m not quite sure what this looks
    like yet, but one of the ways I’ve been trying to do it is through the “Happenings” section, which looks at regional news,
    highlights non-western (though ultimately usually still English language) news sources, and contextualizes that news around
    the weekly topic.
 3. To highlight the different ways that design manifests around the world, ESPECIALLY where it doesn’t get framed as design. IR
    scholar Cynthia Enloe suggests that “Making feminist sense of international politics requires that you exercise genuine
    curiosity about each of these women’s lives—and the lives of women you have yet to think about.” I believe that this
    person-centric lens on the international is the most meaningful entry-point for designers, and perhaps one that should be most
    familiar to designers. Engaging with the question of who does the “invisible work” of global affairs becomes a foundation for
    considering how design can have impact. I’m interested in looking past the often homogenous cliques of world leaders, looking
    at why power dynamics are the way they are, and looking to the individuals and groups engaged in those systems.

INFORMING
My goal here is to highlight news that you might not see if you weren’t looking for it. I consume a lot of news, and I recall when
I was living in the states, most of that news was caught up in American federal politics. Since moving to Copenhagen, I’m still
pretty wrapped up in American politics to be honest, but I’ve also been following a lot more news from the Middle East (I’m
learning Arabic), from China and East Asia out of interest, from Africa as part of my masters and startup mentorship activities
(that part is a bit random), and of course, lots and lots of European sources.

I don’t think you need to consume all of that. I probably shouldn’t. But as there’s a topic each week, I think the exercise of
reflecting on that topic through the lens of these articles (primarily in the Happenings and Security Blanket sections) helps
flush out the argument and gives you a starting point to structure your own view.

INSPIRING
My perspective on all this is shaped by the designers and thinkers I’ve had the good fortune to work with, not to mention the
near-unlimited access to the process stories of incredible design work from around the world. In the Design Voices, Feature, and
ultimately this main writeup, I’m hoping to bridge design practice to the global in a meaningful way, and set the example of how
individuals and groups are already engaging in this work.

ACTIVATING
Finally, this is where I’m going to be developing this newsletter as I would develop an application. I want to use this platform
as a way to create tools that help people get involved. Right now, that just looks like the job postings I share each week. But
I’m also writing how-to guides and resources for preparing for international work and jobs, as well as personal design tools (like
the Covid Anxiety forecasting game [https://divergeweekly.comhttps://divergeweekly.commy%20wife%20and%20I%20made] my wife and I
made) that will help bring a level of focus to that work.

So. There is a lot going on here, and already from starting 6-7 weeks ago on this project, my perspective is changing and
narrowing in quite a bit. Fundamentally though, I want to thank you for subscribing early and helping me get this going. It means
a lot. Most of you are friends or former colleagues, some of you found your way here from my design research and consent app, 
Knowsi [https://knowsi.com], and some of you just found your way here some other way. But I’m super grateful that you’re here.
Also, if you want to give me any feedback (some of you have filled this out already), I have a small feedback form I sent out in
Issue 3 which is still open [https://andrewlb.typeform.com/to/AGyImr].

REDESIGNS?
You might also notice that the newsletter and DivergeWeekly.com site have the beginnings of a redesign. The first version of the
newsletter came together in January in two or three days. It’s a heavily DIY project. As a quick intro: I wrote the newsletter
generator using GatsbyJS, a static website/blog tool I use for my website andrewlb.com. I modified it pretty heavily so that in
additional to creating a static site (hosted on GitHub), it also generates the files for the newsletter, and uploads it to my
self-hosted newsletter application, Sendy.co.

From there, each week I write this newsletter in Markdown, compile it using the special format that I developed, make sure
everything is in place, and hit send.

The first site didn’t have any visual design applied to it. This next version will have a fair bit more, and I’m hoping to get
some help from someone with better visual design chops to develop the brand and layout a bit. However, what you’re seeing is the
first step, and you can expect more changes in format and visuals to come along.

Additionally, I’m working on changing up the data model a bit so that it’ll be easier to see the Design Voices, News, and perhaps
most important, jobs in a single place. That won’t happen immediately (this is a late night passion project), but expect to see
that coming up.

Finally, I mentioned the how-to guides and similar. I’m going to be interviewing other designers with international work
experience both on the consulting and employment side of things in the weeks to come. So if you know anyone who fits that bill, 
please let me know, as I’d love to chat [alb@andrewlb.com].

East AsiaThe SARS epidemic and its aftermath in China: a political perspective [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92479/]SARS scared
the hell out of a lot of people. Right now, many are questioning why SARS was ignored by most nations, given its potential as a
strong signal for what we might expect in the future: not the same but reflective. Written in 2004, I found this article to be
interesting for its “near term” look at the impact SARS had on China. Ultimately, it suggests that the political pressure that the
disease was putting on elites was a primary motivator in mobilizing intervention. The question is: how can we tighten the feedback
loop between political pressure and elite action to combat such crises before things go too far astray?

South AsiaSingapore is the model for how to handle the coronavirus
[https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615353/singapore-is-the-model-for-how-to-handle-the-coronavirus/]Different political systems
have been responding to covid-19 differently. Singapore in particular has emerged as handling the crisis with alacrity — rapidly
mobilizing to track its spread and leveraging intensive surveillance measures to keep new cases in check. This type of response is
difficult to manage outside of strong centralized governments, as we’re seeing with the different state-based responses in the
United States in the face of Presidential ineptitude. As more countries are looking to the success stories of Covid-19, the onus
will be on designers and engineers in implementing what will likely be an increased demand for surveillance, and perhaps one
coming from the citizenry itself.

AmericasWhy is the world so poorly prepared for a pandemic of hypervirulent avian influenza?
[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08910600600866544?scroll=top&needAccess=true&]Another reflection on SARS only barely
in the rear-view mirror — this 2006 article asks why we were (and are) so poorly prepared for a pandemic. A central argument is
that infectious disease must be reframed as a vital security issue — internationally, regionally, domestically — in order to both
prepare as we do for militarized conflict, and to appropriately leverage alliances is combatting a spreading infection. By
securitizing the disease (yes, securitize is a word, at least as far as the Copenhagen school is concerned), the scope of
potential actions and outcomes changes. I think this capacity to reframe is a helpful lens for designers when engaging challenges
that often seem insurmountable; plus this article is just an interesting read for where we find ourselves today.

MENA90 Years Could Pass Before We Learn the Lessons of Israel’s Coronavirus Crisis
[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-90-years-could-pass-before-we-learn-the-lessons-of-israel-s-coronavirus-crisis-1.8734477?=&ts=_1586296667077]
Sometimes, introspection comes too late. The safest way to consider global pandemics is to just assume that one will happen
eventually. Israel has an incredibly well developed intelligence community and a political community tightly coupled to the
military, and there is a certain (arguably reasonable) default towards sealing things for the future (the incredible book Rise and
Kill First being a testament to that). But this article presents some interesting arguments for why certain defaults around
secrecy need to be reconsidered with a lens towards collective health and introspection.

AfricaCrowd in Ivory Coast destroys coronavirus testing centre in residential area
[https://www.france24.com/en/20200406-crowd-in-ivory-coast-destroys-coronavirus-testing-centre]The most terrifying thing about
this virus is how it turns demographic groups against each other. The young a threat to the old, people from one city are shunned,
and in the west in particular — a flood of racism against Asians and the symbols of sickness (face masks, coughing, etc.) A
fascinating corollary to this is violent response to the vital infrastructure of responding to a pandemic, as described in this
article. This is where good communication design and service design could play a vital role, shifting the negative association
with state over-reach towards one of support and safety.

EuropeChernobyl’s on Fire. Great. [https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7jga7/chernobl-fire-radiation]While this seems somewhat minor
relative to a global pandemic, I just wanted to include it here as a reminder of how these risks and events compound. Every system
has its breaking point, and while we can adapt to a lot, there’ll be a certain point where things start to fall apart. I’ll admit
that my biggest long-term fear with Covid-19 is that resilience within our systems will be consistently weaker, simply because we
don’t know when a wave of infection might hit critical personnel, or we have to limit response size to balance risk and capacity
for healthcare providers. What happens to forest fire crews or military basic training? So look for these small cracks. I think
we’ll be seeing more.

SECURITY BLANKET
Source: Unknown  [https://divergeweekly.com/static/da88e7c997aef6dc71d8f9c8b7f915ba/36dd4/stockpile.jpg]US cast as culprit in
global scrum over coronavirus supplies
[https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-united-states-cast-as-culprit-in-global-scrum-over-supplies/]

One of the most striking things about the Covid-19 pandemic has been the surge in protectionist measures that different countries
have taken. It makes sense. The generous argument is that a country manages its own crises, and then is able to open up to help
its allies. Sitting here in Denmark as we’re beginning to loosen restrictions, I’m watching the Danish relationship with the much
more at-risk Sweden around that particular theory.

But then there’s the more realist view that this was inevitably going to be the response — that state structures hold primacy, and
that the state places its own power and security over all other things. What we’ve seen so far certainly can be seen as supporting
that view. Countries are desperately competing for supplies, with the US leveraging its incredible wealth to push many of its
allies around — most recently with the supposed hijacking of a personal protective equipment shipment to Germany.

GLOBAL DESIGN JOBS
Data Storytelling in Hong Kong Graphics and Data Journalist, Bloomberg [https://careers.bloomberg.com/job/detail/81743]Located in Hong Kong

This looks like a pretty awesome data and visual storytelling role with a good technical piece thrown into the mix. You’d be
working with the Bloomberg News Graphics Team, and definitely involved in the newsroom scrum. If you’re currently in a product
role and looking for something faster pace, this might be a really incredible experience.

Journalism Fellowship in EuropeGoogle News Initiative Fellowship [https://journalismfellowships.eu/]Located in European Countries

This looks like an incredible bridge from either an existing design career or a journalism-oriented degree into the newsroom.
Taking place across a number of countries within Europe, it’s an 8 week funded fellowship program taking place this summer.

This excellent article on AIGA’s magazine, Eye on Design, provides some examples of how (specifically communication and service)
design has an incredibly impactful role to play in communication around public health. As we’re seeing with the current crisis, so
much of what we believe about this pandemic — whether it comes to masks, herd immunity, or ones own risk profile — comes down to
what we glean from the information around us.

DESIGN VOICES
Chris Wronski [https://divergeweekly.com/static/c86c4d668232f1fc4ab336ee23e68983/1c72d/wronski.jpg]CHRIS WRONSKI
Design Lead, Fjord Copenhagen

I first met Chris in San Francisco when he was working with Adaptive Path, and later re-connected with him in Copenhagen where he
works with my wife at Fjord. Holding both American and Polish citizenship, Chris was able to travel quite easily within the EU,
and has used that border-flexibility to travel quite broadly. Whether it’s bike-packing trips from Denmark to Norway, traveling to
Sweden to interview Syrian refugees for an upcoming film he’s supporting, or carefully documented motorcycle trips across Italy —
Chris brings artful communication and storytelling into everything he does.

@LibyaLiberty [https://twitter.com/LibyaLiberty]Please share Diverge weekly, either by forwarding this email or by sharing this
link.https://divergeweekly.com/issue/5/ [https://divergeweekly.com/issue/5/]Diverge Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice.
Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
