[https://divergeweekly.com/]EVERY WEDNESDAY, A LOOK AT DESIGN AND DESIGNERS THROUGH THE LENS OF GLOBAL AFFAIRS.
ISSUE #9: THE DEPENDENCIES ISSUE

Image credit: Outside Tehran by AbbasHi all,

First, thank you and welcome to all the new subscribers, and to Hillary Predko [http://hillarypredko.com/] for sharing Diverge in 
The Prepared [https://theprepared.org/]. This is a weird newsletter that aspires to be about design and global affairs — but I
take some latitudes.

The pattern of my day-to-day life is mostly contingent. It rests on the physical infrastructure that makes urban living possible.
It is attuned to the temporal and interpersonal nature of knowledge work. It is capillary to the logistics of on-demand
consumerism and platform capitalism [https://amzn.to/3b5wjGt]. And it sets tempo to the increasingly stressed network of labour
that empowers my own specialization.

DSCF7681 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/76e9bf59452a745b2d01087c250863e1/1c72d/DSCF7681.jpg]Over the past months, those
dependencies have started to show their cracks. I recently had my Gore Tex jacket fail, and so the weird properties of Gore Tex
have been on my mind.

As designed, the multiple layers of Gore Tex work together to keep you dry and climate controlled in some pretty grim conditions.
It has the remarkable property of being both water proof and breathable — allowing moisture to pass away from your body while also
preventing water from entering. Also durable, light, etc etc. It’s magic. Having been trapped for hours in a mid-May downpour
while bike camping in Sweden, I love Gore Tex.

But it’s also a fragile fabric. After only a few wears, the body’s oils and dirt will start to permeate the fabric, causing the
laminate of different materials that provide for these unique properties to shear off — bubbling up and giving the garment an
almost organic appearance [http://tectahoe.com/delamination/] as it delaminates. Repeated use and friction can cause the tape that
prevents seams from leaking to peel away, while improper care will undermine the jacket’s first line of defence — a hydrophobic
coating called Durable Water Repellant [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_water_repellent] — and cause the entire garment to
soak through.

Taken together, Gore Tex is a pretty complex material that relies on and leverages multiple systems to perform its function of
keeping its wearer dry, INCLUDING the labour and consciousness of its wearer. Failing to wash the jacket, or to properly care for
its DWR coating leads to a systemic failure and a wet inhabitant.

DSCF7208 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/e1bd39ba714c2149886d61cdc3548aaa/1c72d/DSCF7208.jpg]The past few months have taught me
about the fragility and interdependence of so many of our systems — especially those systems that underpin our own identities.
Part of my identity is being a bit frenetic — constantly reading, writing, making, exploring. Not necessarily anything good, or
particularly long lasting (my short-lived foray into woodworking being an example of this), but it’s part of who I am.

However, the liberty to be that frenetic comes with an absurd web of dependencies. It’s facilitated by leisure time that comes
from position, job expectations, and a certain earning power — itself constructed of a lucky mix of skills and interests within a
market, and the cultural narratives around their value. It’s purchased with the labour of others: those who deliver groceries and
meals when my wife and I are two exhausted to cook; the incredible childcare workers who care for and teach our son during our
work day; the front-line retail and service workers whose work supports the enterprises who end up being my clients — this list
can go for a while.

When the coronavirus hit and things shut down, it was like that taped seam ripped or the DWR failed: the bubble built around me
wetted through and suddenly the contingent identity was compromised. For me, the dependence on childcare and absolutely
catastrophic impact of working full time while caring for a one-year-old was my untaped seam. The fatigue and stress undermined
everything else. With daycares now open, I think about this weakness every single day.

DSCF7929 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/bd2150150f50b5ee8627cfb7234fcbe4/1c72d/DSCF7929.jpg]In many ways though, I like having
these dependencies. I love what I do (whatever it is that I do), and am massively grateful for the repeated opportunities to do it
(whatever that might be). Having someone to thank, to be connected with, and to follow the trail of their experiences as well —
these are wonderful things. As is having someone else think about where I get my water 99.9% of the time. Human and physical
infrastructure facilitates that opportunity. But the current global crisis — in its utterly tragic and freakishly muted way — is
surfacing the stories of where those dependencies suddenly end. When we played our catastrophe forecasting game
[https://andrewlb.com/writing/anxietygame/] last month, it also gave my wife and I the chance to game out how that disappearance
of resources and infrastructure might transform our own lives.

So. I’m not quite sure what to do with this anxiety. But the thing that came to mind was perhaps how to be comfortable in
dependency but resilient to insecurity. Kind of like a prepper with good healthcare — building resilience where it makes sense to
build resilience, and reinforcing dependencies where it makes to reinforce those dependencies.

Stockpiles that lend resilience might be an appropriate amount of food, a medical kit (and the knowledge to use it) for your
family and your neighbour, some liquid assets wherever possible, and contractual relationships (rent, subscriptions, debts) within
whatever means might be possible. Dependencies to cultivate might be a good relationship with a family doctor, friendships built
on shared labour and goals, the maintenance of a shared building or public space, and healthy engagement in local political
institutions.

Of course, all of the above is itself contingent. A meaningful relationship with your doctor is unlikely to develop if a single
medical professional is covering an impossibly large community. Contractual relationships like employment are difficult to
navigate when power asymmetries undermine ones options [https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/04/29/Leaving-Amazon]. Liquid
assets can scarcely be accumulated without a market that values your labour, or fails to compensate you fairly for it.

DSCF7145 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/faeac7691ed1986424aa45004c79f6cb/1c72d/DSCF7145.jpg]A Gore Tex jacket properly cared
for will last you a long time. But getting that jacket in the first place —with the protection it affords and the opportunity to
care for it— is a lucky and privileged thing. I do think about the weakness that the coronavirus exposed daily, but I also think
about the strengths and imbalance that it surfaced. After all, a failing motor that sputters to a halt still takes you a bit
further down the road through simple momentum. And so I think we’ll see that the catastrophic failure of a business will still
facilitate opportunities and networks that can cushion its beneficiaries from absolute destitution. Hopefully too, a tragically
undermined social safety net in the US will still provide citizens a small economic buffer — even if it comes with the mad king’s
signature [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/politics/stimulus-check-trump-signature.html]. If nothing else, this crisis has
taught us that having access to and wearing the right protective gear saves lives.

So I’ll continue to build dependencies even with their fragility: My life has been richer and stronger for it. But within that
web, I’ll strive to at least see those dependencies for what they are [https://amzn.to/2LaUKYd], to adjust those relationships as
they evolve, and to build in the redundancies that support my community, my family, and my ability to be who I am.

Stiven Kerestegian [https://divergeweekly.com/static/9bb22c12958362e2f2bc5bbddbd53bda/1c72d/stiven.jpg]STIVEN KERESTEGIAN
Head of Innovation, INGKA

Stiven is a singular designer. With experience as an industrial designer with Microsoft (I watched him pick up a mouse once and
say “Oh hey, I designed this.”), he moved through his own social enterprise into the world of co-creation: leading co-creation
efforts at LEGO, heading up innovation at the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design, and now leading the Innovation and
Co-Creation at INGKA/IKEA.

The global lens that Stiven brings to his work empower him to work as a designer in unusual domains. Born in Chile, growing up in
the US, moving to Patagonia for his social enterprise, then to rural Denmark to work with Lego, then Copenhagen for CIID, and
Sweden for IKEA — he’s brought together a unique societal-level vision for design’s capacity to influence. With Co-Creation in
particular, it’s a vision of how both design outcomes and a design mindset can spark a movement within a massive international
organization.

With everything else, Stiven also cofounded Chilote Shoes with his wife, Francisca Apparcel. Those shoes are pretty incredible and
you should check them out.

South AsiaIndia to launch massive evacuation mission
[https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/coronavirus-india-plans-evacuate-citizens-stranded-200505091631533.html]There’s a chilling
push/pull on people’s lives described in this article. Large scale repatriation of foreign workers and those who have built a life
as expatriates means looser ties and less capacity to recover global relations.

AmericasCanada succeeded on coronavirus where America failed. Why?
[https://www.vox.com/2020/5/4/21242750/coronavirus-covid-19-united-states-canada-trump-trudeau]Democratic institutions are
critical infrastructure. In times of crisis, the collaboration between different levels of governance becomes a deciding factor in
good or poor outcomes, and we’re seeing this play out between two neighbors.

East AsiaThe Pandemic Is Cover for a Crackdown in Hong Kong
[https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/22/hong-kong-protests-china-coronavirus-pandemic/]One more tragedy of this virus. Popular
movements have the dependencies of density and sustained force. This virus has undercut both, and now we’re seeing active
retribution while the world is distracted.

MENAWhy Lebanon’s Protesters Are Back
[https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/01/lebanon-protests-back-streets-economic-crisis-debt-default-lockdown/]Lebanon is always
interesting. But after decades of corruption, foreign manipulation, bad luck, and war, the country is in a uniquely vulnerable
position for the economic fallout of this virus. Perhaps the only way out: a fraught dependency on an IMF loan.

[https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/crp/2020/03/31/covid-19-in-africa-know-your-epidemic-act-on-its-politics/]This article takes a super
interesting “meet the user where they are” mindset to global health policy, as well as approaching the politics of the pandemic as
something with material properties.

EuropeChallenges to U.S. Sanctions Against Iran During the Coronavirus Pandemic

to avoid US sanctions on Iran. This is one of the better articles I’ve found describing what Instex is and how it works. Slightly
arcane and super interesting for what it tells us about the need to REDUCE global dependence on the US.

Peace Isn’t a Casualty of COVID-19 in Fragile States
[https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/28734/making-sure-peace-isn-t-a-casualty-of-covid-19-in-fragile-states]

This article is a great overview of where dependencies are suddenly failing, leaving weakened communities and threatening the
central institutions of peace. From day-labourers cut out of vital work in Afghanistan to East Timor seeing its financial
safety-net pulled out from under it — fragile and developing states around the world are seeing their citizens’ most fundamental
expectations about government and their lives tested in ways that are unfair and could have been at least buffered. Not working
for a day without any savings leave you hungry and weak, not working for a few days leave you desperate. A weakened community and
a weakened state are unable to fill the gap, and we might see desperate people do desperate things.

This article has a number of recommendations and principles about how the international community can help avoid the worst
outcomes — with all sectors having a part to place from commercial services to religious communities to public sector entities.
Dependencies often go both ways: debt holders don’t want to see countries bearing the debt default; nor do they want to see the
humans who constitute those nations thrown into even greater chaos (one hopes, anyway). And so discussions of debt relief on the
national scale could be a vital pressure valve for otherwise terribly leveraged developing economies.

GLOBAL DESIGN JOBS
Graphic Design with the UN Graphic Designer, UNDP Armenia [https://jobs.undp.org/cj_view_job.cfm?cur_job_id=91360]Located in Armenia

An awesome role for a visual designer with a strong print background and some Armenian language skills. While initially a contract
role, from what I’ve heard such roles at the UN are gateways into the organization. Apply by May 20th!

AI & Design in CairoUX Design Team Lead, INTDV [https://apply.workable.com/intdv/j/1A6C7F2FB7/]Located in Cairo, Egypt

This looks like it could be a fascinating job. Intdv is a KSA-based automation company, though this role is based in Egypt. It’s a
little difficult to tell what it is they actually do, but seeing a company like this outside of silicon valley has me immediately
curious for the perspective it might bring. Give it a look.

[https://divergeweekly.com/issue/9/]Diverge Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice.
Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
