Image credit: Bruce DavidsonHi all,

As the exogenous force of coronavirus has pummeled the globe, America has had its own endemic disease roar to the surface.

On February 23rd, Ahmaud Arbery was chased down while he was on a jog by vigilantes in Georgia and murdered in a terrifyingly
modern lynching [https://www.vox.com/21263899/ahmaud-arbery-lynched-video-mcmichael-glynn-county-georgia]. Because they are white,
because Ahmaud was black, and because Georgia remains a bastion of white supremacy in the United States, Ahmaud’s murderers were
initially released and uncharged. It was only after the video became public that any form of criminal proceedings started 74 days
after his murder
[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/outraged-by-the-delayed-arrests-in-killing-of-black-jogger-protesters-in-georgia-demand-justice/2020/05/08/8e7d212a-90a9-11ea-9e23-6914ee410a5f_story.html]
, on May 7th.

2020 15 2 2 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/ed4c1859ff1414f9e8642e768182cdc4/1c72d/2020-15-2-2.jpg]On March 13th, Breonna
Taylor, an EMT in Kentucky, was shot eight times in her home after police entered on a “no knock” warrant
[https://www.vox.com/2020/5/13/21257457/breonna-taylor-louisville-shooting-ahmaud-arbery-justiceforbre]. As the police did not
identify themselves, Breonna’s boyfriend Kenneth Walker thought they were experiencing a home invasion and attempted to defend
himself and Breonna. Gun ownership is widespread and legalized in the US, and Kenneth fired at the legs of one of the officers,
not knowing it was the police. Breonna Taylor was killed by indiscriminate return fire. Kenneth’s call to emergency services
stated “I don’t know what happened … somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend.” Shortly after, he was arrested by the
police for assault. The individual the police were searching for was already in police custody
[https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/13/breonna-taylor-not-target-louisville-police-investigation-when-shot/5181690002/] 
when the police invaded Taylor and Walker’s home.

On May 25th, video surfaced of Christopher Cooper, a New York City birder, being verbally attacked by Amy Cooper (no relation) in
Central Park [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/nyregion/amy-cooper-dog-central-park.html]. Christopher was birding, and Amy was
walking her dog without a leash in a section of the park that requires leashing. When Christopher asked her to restrain her dog,
Amy called the police on Christopher and specifically identified him as “African American” in an attempt to express her
understanding of power over him as a white woman living in a society founded on white supremacy. Amy’s actions resulted in her
losing her dog and her job, as well as her being brigaded online
[https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/brigading-online-poll-meaning]. But in a time before smartphones and online video,
Christopher might have lost his life and certainly would have lost his dignity, his freedom, and his security.

Finally, on the same day in Minneapolis, a white police officer had his knee on the neck of George Floyd — choking him to death
[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html] over the accused use of a counterfeit $20 bill and
George’s justified fear of the men who had taken him into custody. The police officer’s knee didn’t move for eight minutes and
forty-six seconds as George begged for his life, lost consciousness, and died.

In the week since George Floyd was murdered, protests have started and escalated across the United States
[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52872401] and around the world
[https://www.npr.org/2020/05/31/866428272/george-floyd-reverberates-globally-thousands-protest-in-germany-u-k-canada]. For
example, in Copenhagen 2000 people in Copenhagen marched Sunday
[https://www.thelocal.dk/20200531/over-1000-protest-in-denmark-over-the-death-of-black-american-george-floyd] in front of the US
embassy, a sign of support and outrage against a system that the United States has —unfortunately — come to stand for: white
supremacy.

DSCF8251 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/e32575243196f3c7c529e43d157bc07a/1c72d/DSCF8251.jpg]I write a lot about systems in this
newsletter, and how systems come to be influenced, leveraged, and undermined. I believe that the real intersection between design,
politics, and international relations is around this capacity to not DESIGN systems (which is hubristic and insane), but rather
influence and navigate systems (which we can do both intuitively and intentionally).Trevor Noah articulated the flashpoint of the
past month brilliantly [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4amCfVbA_c], starting with Amy Cooper. “You have this woman who blatantly
knew how to use the power of her whiteness to threaten the life of another man and his blackness.”
[https://youtu.be/v4amCfVbA_c?t=214].

Amy Cooper was intuitively leveraging a system of power that is endemic to the United States. Because of the circumstance of her
birth, her geography, her genetics, and the history of the country she inhabited; she occupied a space where she could exercise
power. Given her acculturation and lack of critical engagement, she understood how she could use that privilege to get what she
wanted.

In Isabel Wilkerson’s book The Warmth of Other Suns [https://amzn.to/2zXxYkN] on the migration of black Americans away from the
South between the 1920s and the 1970s, she describes the violence that black Americans faced and that was utterly normalized in
that society. Speaking of the period following World War 1, she states “All blacks lived with the reality that no black individual
was completely safe from lynching.”

This is the reality of American society that many have tried — in different ways — to heal, to cure, to expunge. The election and
widespread popularity of a black American president, the passing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, abolishing the 13th amendment
and banning slavery. These are all incredible and laudable steps, but are they just treatments for something that lies at the very
centre of American society? Something that is endemic? What I’ve learned and come to believe over the years is that perhaps this
can’t be cured or treated in isolation — instead that the problem cuts across the whole system.

Currently, in America, people are on the streets questioning the very foundation of that system and whether it is actually worth
saving. The far left wing of the Democratic Party is asking the same thing — is it time to completely remake the system?
Overwhelmingly the protests have been peaceful (which is the ideal and according to scholars like Erica Chenoweth, ultimately a
hell of a lot more successful [https://amzn.to/2Xrixdq]), but I think it’s also important to acknowledge the legitimacy, the rage,
the fear, and the trauma that spurs more violent forms of protest and property damage. The razing of a police station
[https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/29/minneapolis-police-protest-george-floyd-288361] after the police murdered an innocent
man can be argued as proportional — property can be rebuilt as funded by taxpayers, but a life stolen is lost forever.

DSCF5872 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/7763ab2486623e94dd01ab9f204fd450/1c72d/DSCF5872.jpg]Systems of power and oppression are
often parasitic to something more fundamental: powerful actors within those dominating systems irrevocably wrap themselves in the
flag, for example. They will insist that to question it is to question other values, peoples, and histories. But it’s more
complicated than that. America should be proud of its role in crushing fascism and the Nazis in World War II, while also being 
ashamed that black American soldiers were lynched for walking with pride upon returning home from the war.
[https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-tragic-forgotten-history-of-black-military-veterans] Systemic ideals like checks and
balances between the governing houses and the rule of law can be lauded for their intention, even if the result included the
perpetuation of Jim Crow laws in the South for most of the 20th century, and a defacto or new Jim Crow [https://amzn.to/2XvMDN0] 
system through mass incarceration of black Americans,

Anyway. Something has to change. America as a concept and as a country will not collapse if state and local police are held to a
higher account [https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-rashawn-ray-police-violence]. It is not unpatriotic to do everything
in your power to destroy the gerrymandered voting system that perpetuates white supremacy in elected offices and violence against
black Americans in their policies [https://www.propublica.org/article/partisan-gerrymandering-is-still-about-race]. And it is
absolutely reasonable to insist that black lives matter more than the property, prosperity, and power built through the centuries
long perpetuation and continuous reinvention of a racist caste system.

When Jim Crow Reigned Amid the Rubble of Nazi Germany
[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/magazine/blacks-wwii-racism-germany.html]

I got curious about this while reading of Robert Joseph Pershing Foster’s military service in Germany before and after World War
II in The Warmth of Other Suns. His experience sounded like something that was all too common, and unfortunately it was. This
article does a good job of reviewing the contribution of black Americans in the war against fascism, and the reality that many
white American soldiers brought the norms and expectations of a Jim Crow America with them in their dealings with their fellow
soldiers.

It’s worth giving this article a read. I didn’t know a fair bit of this history, and while much of it wasn’t surprising, some of
the ways that race and class played into cold war posturing was quite new. Finally, I found this quote summed things up
effectively:

“Despite their treatment by white American service members, a number of black troops expressed their preference for life in
Germany compared with back home. The percentage of black G.I.s extending their tours of duty in Germany was three times that of
white G.I.s.”

the repetition of images of police patrol cars on fire in every city is really powerful

in Hong Kong following new criminal laws tied to HK freedom of expression, the CCP has been facing renewed scrutiny and a trade

CCP is using it as a way to accuse the US of hypocrisy.

READING AROUND
The Warmth of Other Suns [https://divergeweekly.com/static/0a1bc9cec5113024ae51375de221806e/1c72d/warmth.jpg]THE WARMTH OF OTHER
SUNS: THE EPIC STORY OF AMERICA'S GREAT MIGRATION
Isabel Wilkerson

I’ve been picking at this book for a little while now. Isabel Wilkerson tells the story of the black American migration away from
the south. It takes the lens of three individuals: George Swanson Starling, Ida Mae Brandon Gladney, and Robert Joseph Pershing
Foster.

Against the backdrop of their efforts to get ahead in a system designed to keep them down, there are vignettes of the violence and
humiliation experienced by all black Americans in the south. Sadly, some of those experiences and stories sound familiar even
today.

I’m only about halfway through the book right now, and already wish I had read it years earlier. Give it a read or a listen.

Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
