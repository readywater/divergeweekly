[https://divergeweekly.com/]EVERY WEDNESDAY, A LOOK AT DESIGN AND DESIGNERS THROUGH THE LENS OF GLOBAL AFFAIRS.
ISSUE #1: THE AFGHAN PEACE TALK ISSUE
Read in your browser [https://divergeweekly.com/issue/1/]Ashley Hamer [https://divergeweekly.com/static/12c9eac6b378a56cf022db4131df897d/fcda8/anbahhospital.png]
Image credit: Ashley HamerHello!

For most of my adult life, my country (one of them anyway, being a dual citizen between the US and Canada) has been at war
somewhere else in the world
[https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2020/02/war-afghanistan-2001-invasion-2020-taliban-deal-200229142658305.html]. But
the experience of that war for American civilians was often ambiguous or bureaucratic, not tactile or kinetic.

Recently, the announced agreement between the Taliban and US has been a sign that this defining conflict is drawing to a close, 
but many unknowns remain
[https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/04/on-afghanistan-give-peace-a-chance-but-be-wary-of-the-taliban/].
Foremost amongst these concerns is how negotiations with the existing Afghan government will go (as they are not part of the
US/Taliban negotiations). And the bigger question: what will happen to the rights and access that many Afghans have fought to
establish amongst conflict, but outside of the Taliban’s day-to-day control.

Afghan women have particularly led these social changes, and have a lot to worry about with an unshackled Taliban. While
impressive strides have been made in women’s leadership [https://giwps.georgetown.edu/a-new-generation-of-afghan-women-leaders/],
it’s often overlooked that the status of women in Afghanistan had been progressive
[https://www.amnesty.org.uk/womens-rights-afghanistan-history] prior to the Soviet-led coup in 1978. This event sparked the
formation of an insurgent Mujihadeen and eventual rise of the Taliban in the 1990s, and with their rise, the persecution of and
restrictions on women they enforced. A rehydrated Taliban power in Afghanistan might mean that much of what women have fought for
in the past decades will be repressed again, and those women and men who have led that fight will face retaliation.

Consider this in the context of the impressive design work emerging from Afghanistan — both tangible product and services
supporting people. I want to draw attention to The Anabah Maternity Center [https://aquietrevolution.emergency.it/#/introduction] 
as a bright spot in how vital service delivery — in this case reproductive care — in Afghanistan is meeting both the health and
cultural needs of those it serves. Originally created and supported by the Italian nonprofit Emergency, the site has really grown
into something led and operated by women serving the needs of their own community
[https://brightthemag.com/health-women-maternity-afghanistan-security-da7a37b8e0bd]. In a country where the female working
population is (and will be) recovering from years of repression, we can celebrate the design and implementation of a healthcare
system led and staffed solely by women. They support other women who otherwise wouldn’t have any healthcare options because of
patriarchal and religious barriers.

Good design doesn’t always come from those trained in design practices, but rather can emerge where a human centred disposition
comes together with a systems-oriented mindset and an inclination to make something tangible. Design training and a tested process
certainly facilitate and make repeatable that emergence, but as designers we can take a lot of inspiration from instances like
Anabah: where its planners and operators performed great service design in the absence of a service designer.

AmericasCoronavirus Fears Have Led To A Golden Age Of Hand-Washing PSAs
[https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811609241/coronavirus-fears-have-led-to-a-golden-age-of-hand-washing-psas]With the surge in
American Coronavirus cases, NPR takes a look at the numerous media touchpoints on hand washing as a mechanism to reduce spread.

East Asia‘More scary than coronavirus’: South Korea’s health alerts expose private lives
[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/more-scary-than-coronavirus-south-koreas-health-alerts-expose-private-lives]
Containing a pandemic is often a matter of surveillance and tracing connections between those affected. While Chinese surveillance
culture is well known, the Coronavirus outbreak has revealed state surveillance in many societies, to the dismay of its citizens.

South AsiaFacebook, Google and Twitter Rebel Against Pakistan’s Censorship Rules
[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/technology/pakistan-internet-censorship.html]Internet Censorship is a major issue around the
world, cutting across autocratic, semi-democratic, and even some democratic regimes. The current situation in Pakistan and the
response of the FAANG companies will be worth watching to understand the privacy and identity are being co-designed on the
international stage.

EuropeInnovation Methodologies for Defence Challenges [http://militaryepistemology.com/imdc-2020-in-budapest-hungary/]Last week, the
IMDC 2020 conference happened in Budapest, bringing together NATO military officials and design thinking practitioners in one
room. It looked like an interesting event, and is perhaps a great pathway for bringing design practice into global affairs.

military over touch-screen tools that may help PLA pilots
[https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3017141/google-denies-link-chinas-military-over-touch-screen-tools-may]

An interesting look at how consumer UX expectations bleed into critical military and defence applications. Having been a product
designer at the Pentagon myself, I can generally say that the state of military UX is pretty dismal EXCEPT for when it is mission
critical. In a culture obsessed with Job Boyd’s OODA loop, speed and efficiency for warfighters is a strong argument. Seeing how
that is playing out in other militaries, I wonder if UX will become yet another front in great power competition.

GLOBAL DESIGN JOBS
Co-Creation ManagerCo-Creation Manager, Aga Khan Foundation
[https://3ga4b0g2bmm2x0mm4aptur1d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/Local-Impact-Central-Asia-Project-and-Co-Creation-Manager-TOR_final_20200228.pdf]
Located in the Kyrgyz Republic or Tajikistan, the Aga Khan Foundation works in poverty reduction in Central Asia. This looks like
an incredible role to apply design experience both in defining a strategy for improving people’s outcomes, and in co-designing
that strategy with the folk who will ultimately be experiencing it. Apply before March 20!

Research in TurkeyResearcher, Amnesty International
[https://careers.amnesty.org/vacancy/researcher---turkey-2803/2831/description/]Located in Turkey Amnesty International is looking
for a researcher to report on human rights issues in Turkey and the surrounding region. While this appears to be a more
traditional research role, and less of a design-centric one, I think it could serve as a fascinating bridge for a design
researcher to transition their values and viewpoint into the policy space. In particular, emphasizing empathy and qualitative
methods in your application would go a long way!

Acting Head of Education, CIID

Fahmida is a fascinating designer. I facilitated a workshop with her in Copenhagen, and got to see her methods for fusing critical
discourse with design talent. She’s a Bangladeshi-American service designer with experience working in education and NGOs around
the world, including time spent in Palestine and Jordan. These days, she’s leading education for the IDP program at Copenhagen
Institute of Interaction Design and giving awesome talks at Interaction 20.

https://divergeweekly.com/issue/1/ [https://divergeweekly.com/issue/1/]Diverge Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice.
Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
