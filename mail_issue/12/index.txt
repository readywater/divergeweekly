ISSUE #12: THE CONSTRAINED ISSUE

Image credit: Amira Al-SharifHi all,

Being a creator of things — software, products, services, policy, etc — means navigating a world of constraints. There were two
stories of constraints that I encountered in the past week which I wanted to share.

DSCF5894 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/13f18fbefc1846bcddb5a94dc68ca337/1c72d/DSCF5894.jpg]The first is about constraints on a
geopolitical scale. My friend Chris introduced me to a new podcast called Wind of Change
[https://crooked.com/podcast-series/wind-of-change/], which explores the potential CIA sponsorship of a popular eighties power
ballad pushing for European unification. Its an absolute trip (the type that starts with a reluctant listen followed by binging
most of it), but it tells an interesting story of constraint.

Given the competition between American and Soviet blocs during the Cold War, many different mechanisms for influence spun out for
lack of the more direct military one. Instead of the two nuclear armed powers going toe-to-toe, competition occurred through proxy
conflicts as with the Soviet engagement in Afghanistan vs. the CIA-backed Jihadis, and through foreign interventions in the
domestic politics of polities across Africa, MENA, and LATAM. It also occurred through weaponized culture like posturing in chess
and the olympics, smuggling banned literature [https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/collection/doctor-zhivago], and perhaps
this particular power ballad. As justifiably divisive as the CIA can be, that such an innovation might have emerged from the
constraints presented by the Cold War and the bureaucracy of the CIA is itself a fascinating mystery to explore.

Constraints create context, and context begets emergence. The speculation about the CIA’s involvement in a heavy metal band has
some credibility partially because these clandestine agencies were scrambling to find ways of exerting influence when the old
methods were no longer tenable options. The whole violent history of humanity skidded to a stop in the twentieth century when the
nuclear sword of Damocles was strung up, but as far as states were concerned, that looming threat didn’t stop them from attempting
to exert power and influence. Just… without cutting the string.

DSCF4660 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/248f3198acb4fde2fe9a0650bb966603/1c72d/DSCF4660.jpg]There are also those structural
constraints which simply close options to individuals. As I mentioned last week, Our Women on the Ground [https://amzn.to/36y6yOr] 
is a focused survey of those systematic constraints. A collection of essays by Arab female reporters, the book recounts many
different experiences of becoming professional journalists in societal conditions that create incredible —sometimes violent—
friction towards those identities.

A favourite was the essay by Amira Al-Sharif, a Saudi photo journalist who grew up in Yemen. One of her stories recounts being
stopped and detained because she wasn’t traveling with male relatives — and was forced to sign a statement acknowledging that
doing so was considered “shameful” in the eyes of the state, or at least the eyes of that agent of the state. Because of her
interwoven identities — as a someone who grew up in Yemen, as a woman, as a reporter, and as someone against whom an armed
authority figure projected a paternalistic power structure — the scope of what and where she can report, and ultimately who she is
able to be becomes inexorably constrained. And yet, reading her essay and her included photography, these constraints have also
given her a lens and sensitivity that empowers her to tell stories and capture photos no one else could.

DSCF5878 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/7f69f975450d1c31cf8eb1b372888af9/1c72d/DSCF5878.jpg]Amira and her fellow authors in Our
Women on the Ground expressed and created as fervently as they could — each encountering different and overlapping constraints in
their individual countries, cultures, and communities. Lina Attalah, founder of Mada Masr [https://madamasr.com/en], writes of her
evolving relationship with her father, relative to her identity as a feminist, an activist, a journalist, and an entrepreneur in
Egypt. That consideration helped her find a point of connection as well: wondering how the constrained expectations the state had
imposed on her father trickled down to her experience with him, and the construction of her own identity.

All of this to say that some strange, terrible, and wonderful things can emerge from constraints. People become who they become;
designs resolve with the needs, resources, and context at hand; and sometimes a particular geopolitical strategic context begets
some chart-topping power ballads. Thinking about the constraints from which something or someone emerges IS ultimately the story.

Simon Herzog [https://divergeweekly.com/static/d1029da95b911c1c367ca31b644943aa/1c72d/simonherzog.jpg]SIMON HERZOG
CEO, Anglemap

Some people are natural explorers. I met Simon through my work and teaching with the Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design,
and our topics of conversation ended up swinging around quite wildly. He has a background in business and venture capital, has
worked as a prison guard, has hiked all around the world, and currently runs professional facilitation and education programs
internationally. You’re as likely to run into him hiking the Pamirs as you are to see him teaching a workshop in Tokyo or running
a research program in Mumbai.

Beyond that, he’s also an avid birder, maker of clothing and camping gear, and the son of Werner Herzog and Christine Maria
Ebenberger. He runs a design consultancy called Anglemap, which you should consider working with.Anglemap
[https://www.anglemap.com/]

He also recently created an application for walking in others footsteps. It’s pretty fascinating.‎Peregrine Journey

East AsiaWhy Japan Doesn’t Learn English
[https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/26/japan-doesnt-want-to-become-another-casualty-of-english/]This was an interesting one, as
ultimately it seems a service and instructional design challenge with massive societal effects. The way one studies for an exam is
perhaps not how one studies for language proficiency, leaving many behind.

South AsiaThe Philippines’ Pandemic Response: A Tragedy of Errors
[https://thediplomat.com/2020/05/the-philippines-pandemic-response-a-tragedy-of-errors/]The trend of demagogic leaders failing to
respond effectively to the coronavirus is another study in constraints. When so much is tied to personality and bluster,
charisma-focused regimes seem to fail in putting science at the fore.

AmericasHow Cubans Lost Faith in Revolution - The New York Times
[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/opinion/sunday/how-cubans-lost-faith-in-revolution.html]The story of Caridad Limonta paints an
interesting societal picture through an individual loss of faith in ideology and purpose.

celebrations around the world, and the many ways that people are finding ways of being emotionally and spiritually close, even
when we have to be physically different.

AfricaSouth African bans on tobacco, liquor amid virus stir debate [https://apnews.com/fd95500dce636f3bc1d60b0e0476eb0f]People will
always find ways around prohibition: culturally and chemically. Taken from one angle, banning substances that objectively put you
at greater risk to the virus makes a huge amount of sense, but from another, such a prohibition might actually encourage riskier
behaviour as people seek our their substance of choice.

EuropeThe Kingdom of Denmark: Battleground for Great Power Competition over Control of the Arctic Region
[https://www.cgai.ca/the_kingdom_of_denmark_battleground_for_great_power_competition_over_control_of_the_arctic_region]I actually
found this pretty interesting. CGAI is a hawk-ish for Canada defence think tank that puts out some decent work. This analysis
raised some interesting points on the geopolitical position Denmark will find itself in balancing the US, Canada, and Russia for
control of the Northwest passage.

READING AROUND

CARRIED
Tim O'Brien

The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien [https://amzn.to/3gC8aLE]

I read this book for Veterans Day last year and was pretty struck by it. It’s a series of short stories that are partially real,
partially fictionalized account of the author’s experience as a young officer in Vietnam. O’Brien quite brilliantly explores the
balance between the real and the half remembered — the way that memory, distance, and shapes our emotional experience and identity
afterwards. The eponymous chapter explores what each individual carried with them, and sets the tone for the detail and
personality of the rest of the book. It’s really fantastic, sobering, and ultimately a pretty quick read that leaves you with a
lot to consider.

SECURITY BLANKET

Five-Year Status Update | Center for a New American Security
[https://www.cnas.org/publications/commentary/women-in-combat-five-year-status-update]Very American centric, but an interesting
survey on the role of women in the combat arms of the US military. Structurally there remains a huge number of barriers, and the
military does appear to be making steps towards opening up those roles.

The section on the special forces community is worth considering. Women have always worked with special forces teams, but often as
outsiders or support personnel. In the US military, SOF has its own procurement and healthcare system that supports the increased
risk its members face, and many of those support roles which can face the same risk don’t get the same level of care if they get
hurt, or quality of equipment to prevent injury in the first place.

So. This is worth keeping an eye on. Countries like Norway and Israel both include women in compulsory conscription, Russia has
historically seen considerable female participation in combat roles, and Canada opened up all roles to women in the eighties with
our charter of rights and freedoms. As the largest military in the world slowly catches up, it will be interesting to see how it
navigates that evolution and how that trickles down into a society as a whole.

GLOBAL DESIGN JOBS
Research Ops for the NHS User Researcher/Research Ops, National Health Service
[https://www.atscloud.co.uk/nhsdigital/displayjob.aspx?jobid=1528]Located in the UK

This is a fun and important role. It’s an opportunity to build out the research operations team at the National Health Service in
the UK. Based in either Leeds or London, you’ll be part shaping an entire community of practice and the tools they use. (I suggest
Knowsi, personally)

Comms internship at WFP Communications Intern, World Food Program
[https://career5.successfactors.eu/career?career%5fns=job%5flisting&company=C0000168410P&navBarLevel=JOB%5fSEARCH&rcm%5fsite%5flocale=en%5fGB&career_job_req_id=122319&selected_lang=en_GB&jobAlertController_jobAlertId=&jobAlertController_jobAlertName=&_s.crb=w50udRB9LA6ZAwuMWckgf39vUWY%3d]
Located in Canada

Great early career step, possibly for someone graduating with a comms or graphic design degree. While this won’t be a role where
you develop your craft deeply, it’ll give you some early insight into how design and strategy work in the NGO world. As someone
who did a policy internship before going into design, I can definitely recommend.

[https://divergeweekly.com/issue/12/]Diverge Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice.
Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
