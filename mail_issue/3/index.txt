You’re likely at home, or I hope you are able to be.

Last week, I wrote about the balance of intervention and foresight [https://divergeweekly.com/issue/2/] in a design-based response
to the coronavirus pandemic, and closed with the William Gibson quote “The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly
distributed.” This means two things: physically and in our daily lives, some of us are experiencing Covid-19 on different
schedules and scales, with Italy being the most egregious case. But it also means our individual construction of the future in a
pandemic is relative to our own experience, and that is the focus here.

Here are three scenarios of this construct that I’ve seen:

 1. An act of Apprehension
    
    I’m in Denmark right now, and writing this on Saturday, March 21st. My wife, my one year-old son, and I have been
    self-isolating for 10 days, as have many of our friends. Today, it’s been two weeks since the last major outing, meeting with
    some friends for lunch. This apprehension is a judgement of risk relative to the array of possible futures at the point of
    decision, and making a “best guess” for which set of possibilities we should prepare. We might have felt pretty dumb pulling
    our son from daycare a few days early if things had turned out fine, but since I’ve worked remotely for two years now
    [https://andrewlb.com/writing/remotework/] we had the right tools and support set up so that the cost of being wrong was
    effectively my son joining a few video meetings and my exhaustion. Ultimately, an act of apprehension can go either way, and
    is a gamble on trying to position oneself along a more preferable future.
    
    
 2. An act of Mitigation
    
    Only yesterday, my university in the UK announced that they were closing the school and modifying distance courses: despite
    the fact that by percentage of the population, the UK has a higher rate of cases than Denmark
    [https://cream.io/?m=tcpp&r=United%20States%2C-45&r=Italy%2C-35&r=South%20Korea%2C-31&r=Denmark%2C-45&r=United%20Kingdom%2C-45&s=log&z=3] 
    – even with Denmark being in lock down for over a week. As cases and deaths grow, PM Johnson’s reactions have been compared to
    that of the Mayor in Jaws
    [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-myth-economy-uk-business-life-death], keeping the beach
    open for tourist season despite a murderous shark in its waters. Here then, our action and judgement is responsive to
    independent variables and driven by the same. Apprehension may drive our consumption of information, but the action of
    mitigation is only to offset damage that is already being done.
    
    
 3. An act of Ignorance
    
    The most worrisome trends are where no action is being taken at all or the threat is seen as negligible. In Denmark, I was
    shocked to see folk pushing past each other while grocery shopping and the school closure being seen as an excuse to party,
    not shelter. This aligns with the stories of American students congregating on beaches for spring break
    [https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-51955362/us-students-party-on-spring-break-despite-coronavirus], or worse, 
    exposure by those attending the rallies of Brazilian president Bolsonaro
    [https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,bolsonaro-tem-contato-direto-com-ao-menos-272-pessoas-durante-ato-mostra-video,70003234397]
    . This route is either willful or unintended: resulting from a dearth of information or — worst of all — given the information
    available, doing nothing or doing harm.
    
    

The problem with these three actions is that they reflect an inflection point that is being considered by everyone: informed by
their lived experience, their state of mind, societal pressures, and access to resources. My decision to self isolate 10 days ago
might have occurred at the same moment in time as someone’s decision that spring break was a great idea.

But these decisions and actions have vital influence on our future and the outcomes we march towards. Design futurist Stuart Candy
is well known for his Cone of Possibility, a rendering of the present squeezing a series of potential futures through its
aperture. The question is: when does the future catch up and which set of actions lead us to what is preferable?

Stuart Candy [https://divergeweekly.com/static/df2b4bdb48dab0c905d1ea2f1595531a/fcda8/cone.png]If we’re looking at the longer tail
of this crisis, apprehension, mitigation, and ignorance might not be all that different in terms of collective outcomes, but they
ARE decisions that we make. This pandemic is a collective action problem: individual actions might offset or buffer one from the
worst (or in the case of the spring breakers, drastically increase their own and others’ risk), the aggregate outcome is still
likely to be the same. But then the question is, at what scale?

If individual action is smoothed over from the lens of the aggregate action or inaction of others, then I would argue that the
route to designing an intervention is to identify the scale and scope of intervention so that ones actions have an outsized
effect. Is it the country? The state? The community? The family?

Consider the the open source community’s effort to expand access to life-saving ventilators
[https://github.com/PubInv/covid19-vent-list]. We don’t actually know yet if this work will do anything particularly productive,
but it is a fervent and well-organized effort to try and do something with the scope that one has. There are dangers and risks
[https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dm4mb/people-are-trying-to-make-diy-ventilators-to-meet-coronavirus-demand], but perhaps the
communal contribution at the appropriate scope can cover that, and perhaps this can multiply the impact at a local level in
communities with maker spaces or universities.

While we may be trapped at a point in a cone hurtling towards a future we can’t really comprehend, I’d argue that we — designers
and design-adjacent creators engaged in a practice that is fundamentally participatory — are incredibly well situated to identify
our scope of impact and organize around it. Design might not have a “seat at the table” (I hate this term so, so much) when it
comes to policy-decisions right now, but we can contribute and organize locally.

Look to Zahra Ebrahim’s Covid-19 Toronto app [https://covidto.glideapp.io/] and the google doc that she coordinated to bring it
all together [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18IAn2bwZeYj2Oy9TdGCO8wB3w3lv3wnLMpyzEYFfWDI/edit]. As a leader in Toronto’s
design community, she turned to her network to identify the needs and resources of her home, but with a designer’s person-centred
bias created something of real value.

Zahra’s work might shift Toronto’s future in a particular way, and if that process can be replicated ten thousand fold around the
world, our family, community, state, country, and civilizational outcomes will be be so much better.

If the future isn’t evenly distributed, how might we distribute the right future more evenly?

On that note, my wife and I created a very bleak, no-fun game last weekend to try a predict and prepare for potential futures
[https://andrewlb.com/writing/anxietygame/] this past weekend. It’s a simulator and scenario generator for what might come for you
specifically in this pandemic, though as my description of our first play-through indicates, the results were exhausting (but
useful). I encourage you to give it a try.

As always, I’d encourage you to subscribe [https://divergeweekly.com] if you haven’t and send me a note [alb@andrewlb.com] if you

complicated. Somehow they must process immense quantities of information—concerning the tastes and incomes of consumers, the
outputs and costs of producers, future products and methods of production, and the myriad of interdependences of all of the above.
The task of gathering this information, let alone making sense of it, is beyond any designing intelligence. But it is not beyond
the market, which yields ‘spontaneous order’ out of chaos. — The Economist's obituary to Friedrich HayekHAPPENINGS

[https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2020/03/21/trudeau-urges-canadians-to-avoid-travel-to-other-provinces.html]Canada is in
a challenging position. Widely distributed with provincially-managed healthcare, the response to the pandemic is likely to be
unevenly distributed and difficult. This threat to exercise federal power is coming as countries around the world do the same. In
your own country, look for the use of police or military force being applied as an executive supplement to healthcare services as
a “sign” of this expanded mandate in a crisis.

MENAHas the coronavirus reached Syria? [https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/has-the-coronavirus-reached-syria-1.70539898]Covid-19 is an
extreme threat to existing power structures: both physically and politically. As seen in Iran, certainly it can infect those in
power, but it also undermines their power base depending on how they handle the crisis. The various Syrian civil war facitons are
now dealing with the potential of an influx of cases, and

[https://observers.france24.com/en/20200305-south-korea-coronavirus-COVID-19-kits-masks]The artifacts of a country’s policy
decision are always fascinating, and the current pandemic is no exception. This article takes a look at how articles of hygiene
are distributed in the environment, and provided to those identified as infected. Given South Korea’s success in combatting the
virus, it’s worth a read.

South AsiaPakistan coronavirus camp: ‘No facilities, no humanity’
[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/pakistan-coronavirus-camp-no-facilities-no-humanity]The architecture and
infrastructure of a crisis manifest in different ways. This camp along the border of Iran and Pakistan was hastily erected to
quarantine those crossing for the incubation period of two weeks, but its conditions were reported as terrible. What we build on
the margins can often bleed inward, and so paying attention to spaces like this, the camps in Syria near Turkey, and distributed
around the EU.

[https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/18/ngos-raise-alarm-as-coronavirus-strips-support-from-eu-refugees]
Vulnerability often describes a state where ones is unable to face further crisis successfully. An many vulnerable peoples look to
Europe for refuge from one crisis, another has suddenly shattered the infrastructure of these potential homes — leaving refugees
without infrastructure or resources, and without coherent strategies to manage in their absence.

SECURITY BLANKET

[https://www.bellingcat.com/news/rest-of-world/2020/03/19/how-coronavirus-scammers-hide-on-facebook-and-youtube/]

The rise of large scale, low cost, multi-actor and wildly decentralized disinformation campaigns is one of the greatest security
threats of our present era. Why? They frustrate meaningful engagement in collective action problems like a national political
process or — just by way of example — global pandemics. They do this to the point of paralysis. Bellingcat paints a striking
picture of what I believe is one of the greatest design failures of the 21st century: the capacity for contemporary disinformation
campaigns (and individual actors) to permeate and diffuse the major social networking platforms that so eagerly embraced human
centered design in their inception and grwoth. I’m inclined to believe that the various platforms are trying to do better (perhaps
not so far as good), but assuming this, their inability to effectively combat disnformation is telling.

GLOBAL DESIGN JOBS
Innovation in KenyaInnovation Director, One Acre Fund [https://oneacrefund.org/work-with-us/job-openings/g/?gh_jid=2058337]Located in Kenya (50%
Kakamega, 50% Nairobi) and must be a Kenyan national

One Acre Fund works with small farmers to boost regional and local productivity. Kenya already has a great innovation economy and
has seen substantive growth, but continues to face great structural challenges. This looks like one of those roles where one could
learn a huge amount while having great impact.

UX for the USLead Program Analyst (UX/UI Design) [https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/562675400]Located in USA (remote) and must be US
national

This looks like a pretty interesting and familiar role to many of you. Effectively a UX design role, it looks like a great
opportunity to work with other civil servants to coach them in human centered practices while doing some solid citizen-focused
work.

Director at IDEO and Palmwood

Mitch Sinclair is an executive designer director at IDEO and creative director at Palmwood, a collaboration between the United
Arab Emirites and IDEO. I met Mitch originally when I was at IDEO Palo Alto, and instantly felt welcome and elevated in how she
collaborated, connected, and created. The future-oriented and design-driven work in the UAE has been consistently interesting and
worth exploring, so I’d encourage you to take a look at Palmwood and the team Mitch is co-creating in Dubai.

https://divergeweekly.com/issue/3/ [https://divergeweekly.com/issue/3/]Diverge Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice.
Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
