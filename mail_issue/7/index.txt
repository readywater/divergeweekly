Image credit: Tadao AndoHi all,

My son had his first day back at daycare today (I’m writing this on Monday).

When he left, he wasn’t yet able to stand on his feet. He was just starting to say “hi” and wasn’t obsessively waving at things.
He wasn’t yet one year. But now he’s (sort of) walking, getting incredibly creative with his toys, and as I tucked him in tonight,
waved sleepily and bid me goodnight with a “Hi.”

DSCF7639 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/033f32782341fe554587545216edf11d/1c72d/DSCF7639.jpg]Navigating the past weeks and
months has been confusing as the coronavirus has made its way around the world and into our lives. At the end of January, I
ordered some masks for the family just in case and at the time worried that they’d only get used the next time we had to paint
something. This past week, my wife and I have been quietly obsessing over whether sending him back to daycare was the right call —
knowing that the health outcomes of our decision wouldn’t reach us for days or weeks.

So much of the work of design is around navigating unknowns, which I’ve written about in the past
[https://divergeweekly.com/issue/2/] few [https://divergeweekly.com/issue/3/] posts [https://divergeweekly.com/issue/4/]. We have
tons of tools to make that navigation a bit less fraught, but ultimately our goal is to reduce the absolute surface area of the
true unknowns and take our best guess at what we should cover it with. A small patch of true Unknown (I’m trying not to invoke
Rumsfeld [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns] here, but you know what I mean) can bring the whole edifice down,
but it’s less likely to.

DSCF7477 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/b1dd2ef9ea0fe3189c51db753f41cf34/1c72d/DSCF7477.jpg]In Copenhagen, the unknowns are
being navigated in several ways. People are out. They’ve active and enjoying public space where they can find them. They’re
keeping their distance. This photo perfectly captured the “vibe” of a weekend in Copenhagen: Small groups keeping their distance.
Masks are still unusual: I wear mine in the market and it clearly surprised people. And the day cares are opening. I navigate
these unknowns in a way that is informed by what I see in Asia, and what North America and Europe are only now coming to
understand.

Looking at the Danish government’s decision to open daycares
[https://www.thelocal.dk/20200413/schools-and-day-care-centres-gear-up-for-staggered-and-restricted-reopening], I see a bit of
this personalized navigation of the unknown. That surface area of True Unknowns has become a little bit smaller, and so perhaps
something can be built on it. The government is setting a scope, and the schools are implementing it as best they can. We’ll know
how it went in a few weeks. Certainly as a parent, the time afforded to work and be productive by state-supported child care is
welcome. I probably had my most productive morning in the six weeks my son has been home during the work day, but I know that time
is built on unknowns. It’s built on the labour of others taking a risk. It’s built on a Danish societal valuation of certain
things over others. It’s built on a risk tolerance that is only possible with privilege.

DSCF7083 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/33d41735cbda841da2e9627c47161f00/1c72d/DSCF7083.jpg]So we’ll see over the next bit. I
know many of you reading this are in Canada and the US, and things are pretty scary
[https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-cases-covid-19?stackMode=relative&time=2020-02-14..&country=DEU+ITA+DNK+CAN+USA]. We’ll
see whether what we built holds. In the end, design is in large part about making decisions based on what we’ve learned and
committing them to form. It’s not faith, but it might be a particular kind of localized interpolation
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation] of what we’ve come to know (or believe) over the true unknowns that still exist
within our scope of design. Of course, our methods of interpolation can skew that result pretty wildly
[https://matplotlib.org/1.5.3/examples/images_contours_and_fields/interpolation_methods.html].

We don’t always get a choice when to navigate an unknown, and we don’t always get a choice in the navigation either. But for now,
this first day with our son back at daycare was scary for the unknown seeds it plants and outcomes that grow out of it. But then,
positively influenced by his playmates and the incredible team of teachers at his school, perhaps we’re focusing on the wrong
outcomes?

Thanks as always for reading this. I tried a bit of a different format this time (lighter content, more visual), and would love to
hear what you think (you can just reply to this email directly).

Alix is an incredible designer and artist, originally from Champagne region of France and currently living and working in
Copenhagen at the UN Refugee Agency (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) as a designer.

Apart from the work she does for the UN, she also does brilliant watercolour work of Copenhagen and beyond under the moniker

Developing Military Vessels at the Center of its Coronavirus Outbreak
[https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/why-china-developing-military-vessels-center-its-coronavirus]

Similar to the earlier Foreign Policy article on Beijing, this article shares some interesting context on Chinese investments in
extending and maintaining power as the existing global system seizes and sputters under the weight of this pandemic.

“China is “taking advantage of the lull in activity” around the world by bolstering its military in nearby seas, said Jay
Batongbacal, international maritime affairs professor at University of the Philippines.”

Again, all of this should be watched with interest and potentially alarm.

GLOBAL DESIGN JOBS
Design Research in TokyoDesign Researcher, IDEO Tokyo [https://www.ideo.com/jobs/design-research/tokyo/2018543/design-researcher]Located in Tokyo

This looks like an awesome role for a Japanese/English bilingual design researcher. One of my big regrets from my time at IDEO was
not making it out to the Tokyo studio, as it sounded like an absolute blast. Strongly recommend applying if you’ve Japanese
language skills!

US CX Multiple CX Roles, USA [https://smeqa.usds.gov/info/cx-govwide/]Located in USA

Through USDS, multiple agencies are hiring for Customer Experience/User Experience roles. Likely you’ll need to be a US Citizen or
otherwise eligible for a federal job, but this is an exciting victory for citizen’s experience using government services at a time
when it is desperately needed.

Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice. Great
services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
