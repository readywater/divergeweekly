WEDNESDAY, A LOOK AT DESIGN AND DESIGNERS THROUGH THE LENS OF GLOBAL AFFAIRS.
ISSUE #2: THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC ISSUE

Image credit: Edvard MunchHello from a shuttered Denmark,

This past week we’ve seen the “exponential” part of exponential growth hit the world like a tidal wave. Markets have dipped,
businesses are scrambling, and the people that constitute both are unsure of what’s coming.

What we’ve seen with this global crisis is a failure in planning, and for those of us who are designers, planning is our business.
At its core, Design is a time-delayed activity: one where we engage with people and systems to plot out a path to a better future
using artifacts and experiences. In this pandemic, we’re instead seeing a reversion. Far from having planned redundancies and
designed for resiliency, we’re instead facing the stark fragility of a system co-designed with agents of unchecked growth and
profit.

In this definition of design, we have two key components: foresight and intervention.

Foresight asks: what is needed in the future? Why do we believe this? What needs to happen for that to exist? What else might
happen? On a systemic and world-spanning extreme, the peak of this practice is in world-building fiction. Books like Max Brooks’
World War Z [https://amzn.to/2TR3O9Z] and Liu Cixin’s The Dark Forest [https://amzn.to/33jAs79] both take a worldly and
step-by-step approach to exploring human behaviour and outcomes given distinct conditions: for World War Z, a global zombie
pandemic; and for the Dark Forest, an impending apocalypse and humanity’s instinct to flee, fight, or simply give up.

For the nearer term, the designer has a host of tools available, from card games like those created by Near Future Lab
[https://nearfuturelaboratory.myshopify.com/products/design-fiction-product-design-work-kit] for generating scenarios, and
structured “gap filling” tools like backcasting
[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249060842_Backcasting_-_A_framework_for_for_strategic_planning] to map the pathway to
the preferable outcomes. But at best, foresight samples and extrapolates from the potential territories that we march toward, and
informs the context and constraints of our design activities.

On the other end is intervention. With the current coronavirus outbreak, the rhetorical focus has very much been on POLICY
interventions: how can we wield the apparatus of states to tackle a collective action problem
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem] like a global pandemic? For examples of this discussion, there’s a great
episode of Vox’s The Weeds [https://megaphone.link/VMP2383267901] on the American policy response, and Vox’s global affairs
podcast Worldly has an additional North American-centric exploration of outcomes and implications as well
[https://megaphone.link/VMP2017093543].

But we’re also seeing an active response in how design engages with the crisis. As Malcom McCullough points out in his book
Digital Ground, “The success of a design is arrived at socially.” Across China —an already incredibly sophisticated and integrated
surveillance state— software serves to mitigate, inform, but also surveil. Chinese public-private partnerships have led to a
colour-code based access system to public space [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html],
with quite legitimate concerns for social acceptance of surveillance post-pandemic. A state’s over-reach might seem prudent in a
crisis, but what provisions are in place to revert once the crisis has passed? We don’t always get Cincinnatus
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Quinctius_Cincinnatus], after all.

South Korea is taking a similar intervention with a different implementation — free drive through testing in your car with a
simple text-message based notification of your results
[https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/815441078/south-koreas-drive-through-testing-for-coronavirus-is-fast-and-free] 
which allows testing infrastructure to be incredibly light weight in a country where two-thirds of people own a car. In other
words, we are seeing “crisis architecture” churn through society once more: the modular hospitals in Wuhan
[https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-building-1000-bed-hospital-over-the-weekend-to-treat-coronavirus] being in the
same family as post-9/11 segmentation of America’s airports
[https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-32-design-for-airports/].

Clearly, design has a role in this crisis, but how does the individual designer engage? The most useless thing I’ve read about the
coronavirus was this list of how design thinking is going to save us from coronavirus
[https://fortune.com/2020/01/28/the-coronavirus-problem-could-be-solved-by-design-thinking/]. If you’re a “design thinker” only
asking these questions now, you’ve already failed. The examples in China and South Korea are an adaptive strategy with an adaptive
design to a fast moving crisis that came from either excellent foresight activities (taking a more strategic approach) or simply
learning the hard way (the more intuitive approach). As such, the context for an appropriate design to emerge, succeed, and
hopefully obviate its utility already exists, as we’re already seeing with the 1000 bed hospital in Wuhan being disassembled
[https://archpaper.com/2020/03/wuhan-shutters-all-temporary-hospitals-covid-19-risk-dissipates/].

As we collectively weather this pandemic, the thing we should recognize is that foresight without intervention is simply
speculation, and intervention without foresight is naive at best [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22453746] and incredibly
harmful at worst
[https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/12/814876173/coronavirus-trump-speech-creates-chaos-eu-says-it-wasnt-warned-of-travel-ban]
. As those working in or adjacent to design, we have a responsibility to look ahead: both systematically using the tools of our
trade, and ambiantly by absorbing information globally and from many sources.

Be safe and by generous. Finally, look after yourself now, because like everyone’s favourite William Gibson quote, “The future is
already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” Just as China is finding itself able to respond to Italy’s needs
[https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/coronavirus-china-sends-medical-aid-to-spain-and-italy] because of how it handled its
own spike in infections, we all might be in a position to help others depending on where we are in our own infection curve.

say that's a miracle. But of course if someone is killed by a freak chain of events -- the oil spilled just there, the safety
fence broken just there -- that must also be a miracle. Just because it's not nice doesn't mean it's not miraculous. - Terry

AmericasThe Next Plague Is Coming. Is America Ready?
[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-the-next-plague-hits/561734/]I found it valuable to revisit this
article from 2018, when there were cries to learn from the risk inherent to the most recent Ebola outbreaks. There is no guarantee
that we will learn from this crisis, and so we must do what we can to build a personal pattern-recognition for the leading signs
and signals of our next crisis.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/iran-coronavirus-outbreak-graves/]Already having faced incredible internal
upheaval in January, Iran has been brutally affected by the coronavirus, evidenced by the digging of mass graves near Qom. The
societal scars of poor foresight, maladapted systems, and just bad luck will be with us for decades; and Iran will be an important
place to watch for social adaptation post-crisis.

East AsiaHealth Care + Design in Singapore [https://blog.centerforinnovation.mayo.edu/2012/02/16/health-care-design-in-singapore/]Singapore
has been lauded has being particularly well adapted to coronavirus and previous pandemics (like SARS). In trying to learn a bit
more about how this happened, I found this to be a useful look at how Singapore has approached the design of its healthcare
system.

South AsiaDesigning a handwashing station for infrastructure-restricted communities in Bangladesh
[https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-877]This is an older article, but an interesting one to
surface. The infrastructure of personal hygiene is always an issue in public health, and one which we readily take for granted.
This article digs into the affordances and cues we need to keep in mind to adhere to protective hygiene in this era, and might be
a useful tool for those of you thinking of setting something up for your community or building.

EuropeCoronavirus offers “a blank page for a new beginning” says Li Edelkoort
[https://www.dezeen.com/2020/03/09/li-edelkoort-coronavirus-reset/]Dutch designer and forecaster Li Edelkoort weighs in on the
possibility of an economic “reset” from coronavirus, especially with regards to globalization of certain local commodities (she
uses the example of saris made in China and imported to India, which have disrupted local design markets).

Islamic State Advice on Coronavirus Pandemic [http://www.aymennjawad.org/2020/03/islamic-state-advice-on-coronavirus-pandemic]

A newsletter to ISIS members, translated by Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi, a researcher focused on the Syrian civil war. As objectively
evil as the Islamic State is, it is still an organization that has to look after its members and do what organizations do:
communicate, align, and act. Some of the language in the newsletter is pretty interesting from that lens and a good cue for how
these kind of societal threats get translated across orgs and cultures.

GLOBAL DESIGN JOBS
Communication in KenyaCommunications Advisor, Médecins Sans Frontières
[https://careers.msf-applications.org/job/Communications-Advisor/518538202/]Located in Kenya MSF is an incredible organization
working around the world in medical disaster response, prevention, and recovery. This role, while it looks like a classic comms
role, might be a really interesting fit for someone with design research experience, but coming from a more formal communication
design or journalism background. The balance of the role points to a design experience with field work, daily response work, and
strategy development.

Technology in the US CongressDirector, TechCongress [https://www.techcongress.io/deputy-director]Located in Washington DC, USA TechCongress is an awesome
program connecting designers and technologists with congressional leaders in the United States. I got a bit of a behind-the-scenes
look during my time at New America, and can enthusiastically recommend the opportunity to work with Travis and his team. This
would be an awesome role for a designer with both technical chops and leadership experience who wants to get involved in
government.

DESIGN VOICES
Cade Diehm [https://divergeweekly.com/static/f570bf7e41384e0b2253ededd80dcd68/e17e5/cade.png]CADE DIEHM
Founder, New Design Congress

Cade Diehm is a designer and thinker based in Berlin, but travels around the world speaking on design through a lens of security,
society, and critical theory. I was first introduced to his work a few years ago through his essay On Weaponized Design, but more
recently have been excited to see what comes out of The New Design Congress. Give it a subscribe below: the first newsletter just
came out last weekend.

The New Design Congress [https://newdesigncongress.org/]

After decades of WFH, I’d need an article with tips on how to work in an office.
[https://twitter.com/tomvanderbilt/status/1238524310035279878]

@tomvanderbilt [https://twitter.com/tomvanderbilt]Please share Diverge weekly, either by forwarding this email or by sharing this
link.https://divergeweekly.com/issue/2/ [https://divergeweekly.com/issue/2/]Diverge Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice.
Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
