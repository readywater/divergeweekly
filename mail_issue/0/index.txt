Welcome to the “preview” issue of Diverge Weekly, a weekly look at systemic design around the world. This is the first issue, the
preview that was used for prototyping and testing the idea. You may not have gotten this in your inbox, but if you did, thank you
for helping make this happen!

To start, this newsletter is an investigation and roundup of the role that design might play in international affairs.

This week, we’re seeing the global spread of COVID-19, or Corona virus, to the Middle East and beyond.New cases popping up in
Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Oman, Quatar, and around the world, cases in the Americas and Europe are causing alarm. Pandemics make
visible much of what we believe and how we behave arounds systemic uncertainty, and often these behaviours manifest through
artifacts tied to sickness. Face masks and hand sanitizer clipped to bags are two artifacts I’ve seen here in Copenhagen, though
the former is perhaps more a totem than something with real utility
[https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/6/21124979/wuhan-coronavirus-face-masks-hoarding]. The real question is whether our focus on
totems might serve to exacerbate the crisis if we hit a certain tipping point
[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-n95-face-masks.html]: yet another object designed for one catalyzing
negative outcomes for many.

In the United States, the democratic presidential primaries are in full swing, with Senator Bernie Sanders emerging as a
frontrunner with message focused around Medicare for All
[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/upshot/medicare-for-all-basics-bernie-sanders.html]. For many of us who have experienced
universal healthcare systems (in my case, Canada and Denmark), the discussion around a need for continued healthcare reform in the
US is exciting and overdue. Good design and good experiences should not only be for the wealthy, and neither should good health
care.

The ongoing battle for Idlib [https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/idlib-battle-syria.html] in Syria presents a less hopeful
lens. Already a humanitarian disaster with countless refugees having fled to Idlib, the convergence of Russian-backed Pro-Assad
forces and Turkish forces (both militia and actual military) has exacerbated their plight. From a design perspective, the
ubiquitous UNHCR tent has been used as cover by pro-Assad forces [https://twitter.com/TitusMichaeleus/status/1184867339331919872] 
to disguise their forces against the onslaught of Turkish airstrikes
[https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200301-turkey-destroys-scores-of-syrian-army-targets-incl-airport-air-defences-and-tanks/].
The subversion of humanitarian objects for military maneuvers is nothing new, but given the humanitarian catastrophe using the
symbols of the oppressed as cover is horrifying.

This is the prototype newsletter, so please let us know what you think [alb@andrewlb.com] and I’m looking forward to building
something you enjoy reading every week!

about an emergent technology and the people who operate them.

[https://divergeweekly.com/issue/0/]Diverge Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice.
Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
