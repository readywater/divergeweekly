Image credit: AP Photo/Thanassis StavrakisHi all,

This will be a quick one relative to some of the essays I’ve been writing recently.

I’ve been reading and thinking about foresight — especially as it relates to the current pandemic and security. As a result, I’ve
been getting interested in why we believe what we believe about the future.

With the rise of platform empires, we’ve effectively ceded the original vision of the internet as a distributed space
[https://anildash.com/2012/12/13/the_web_we_lost/]. Battle after battle of the free internet was lost to convenience, monetization
strategies that drove consolidation, and the pens, mice, and post-its of designers locked in market-driven competition. Some of
the most interesting conversations one can have on this are with Facebook designers who are both critical thinkers (which applies
to many of those I’ve met) and who are anxious about the impact of what they’ve helped create. Yet they find themselves captured
through unvested stock, individual loyalties within their teams, and the completely legitimate hypothesis that they might be able
to make things better.

I don’t really know the answer on this one. We’re all culpable for the internet that we lost
[https://thenextweb.com/eu/2017/06/09/pirate-bay-founder-weve-lost-the-internet-its-all-about-damage-control-now/], and there’s
some very good designers at the platform giants — good in skill and good in soul — who we shouldn’t throw under the bus. But I do
think there’s a meaningful discussion to be had around this idea of capture and recognizing when we ARE captured.

I read an article recently by Patrick Porter on how the British national security apparatus undermined its own foresight efforts
by unconsciously insisting on confidence in their capacity to handle whatever might come
[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-international-security/article/taking-uncertainty-seriously-classical-realism-and-national-security/1022E6B6D12A8902E7F40B575D01C40B]
. This very idea is pathological: that they might both acknowledge the magnitude of the unknowns they face, and still require
confidence that they can wrangle it given our current preparedness. Britain isn’t alone in this, of course. If you’re developing a
product, you’ll experience microcosms of this every day: the feature or design decision you made just doesn’t glom on to reality.
Your user or customer is frustrated, their user or customers are confused — all because your synthesis of their needs and your own
sensibility missed its mark. The difference lies in the speed of iteration.

A designer can (usually) quite easily test their hypothesis. Find a customer, set up a prototype, launch a test, or simply watch
how your (possibly socially distanced) neighbour interacts with it. But of course that’s not so easy for a state’s national
security establishment. Usually, national security institutions are pretty brilliant when it comes to punching through their own
biases, using tools like red teaming [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team] and others to explore alternative scenarios. But as 
Micah Zenko’s book on Red Teaming points out [https://amzn.to/3aaWM4X], the role of the Red Team can often be institutionally
undermined in subtle ways: be it explicitly walking back a decision during a war game
[https://warontherocks.com/2015/11/millennium-challenge-the-real-story-of-a-corrupted-military-exercise-and-its-legacy/] or 
tacitly signalling leadership’s dissatisfaction with the results
[https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/07/red-team-a-tale-of-how-a-general-didnt-listen-to-internal-criticism-in-afghanistan/]. In
both cases, the act of simulating alternative options — of diverging from the current mode of thought — becomes dramatically
constrained by the needs and fears of the commissioning institutions. It’s effectively nullified.

I think the same thing happens to the sensibility of designers captured by institutions. The scope of potential divergence becomes
naturally constrained by the needs of the institutions they serve, and so their sensibility is reinforced and narrowed along those
lines over time [https://divergeweekly.com/issue/4/]. And I think this is part of what I want Diverge Weekly to combat. This idea
of capture is a reflection of a point in time for an individual or a class of designers where the aperture is narrowing. But I’d
like to believe it can still be opened.

So if the intent is to widen that aperture, functionally how do we start to open it again?

That’ll be for future issues.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/world/asia/kabuki-japan-children.html?referringSource=articleShare]A sad and very thoughtful
essay on a fading tradition which forces us to ask WHY we fight so hard for some of the traditions we’ve adopted.

South AsiaExploring Foresight, Epidemiology and the Coronavirus Pandemic with Dr. Peter Black
[https://jfsdigital.org/2020/04/07/exploring-foresight-epidemiology-and-the-coronavirus-pandemic-with-dr-peter-black/]Dr. Black is
an epidemiologist and foresight specialist with experience working around south east Asia. He has a different take from what I’ve
often heard: that our current response is just about as good as it could have been on a macro level. This perspective is
noticeably different from the critique in the US.

set of reporting around President Trump’s response to the Coronavirus, both as the virus grew in scale and before with a
systematic dismantling of America’s protective measures. A must read in considering the US response.

America, Sharon Burke is a former assistant SecDef, deep thinker on systems, and student of the middle east. She takes a broad
look at fragility around the world in this op-ed, and emphasizes the pointlessness of staying on a path that we’ve already seen
doesn’t work.

EuropeDeveloping pandemic preparedness in Europe in the 21st century: experience, evolution and next steps
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3324872/]I’ve been poking through articles like this recently, and found this one to
be interesting for its description of war-gaming pandemic response in a regional context. Living in Denmark now, it’s been
fascinating to see how different countries within the EU are responding, and while the war game described here is certainly a rosy
lens, I suspect it had an influence on widening the aperture.

Millennium Challenge: The Real Story of a Corrupted Military Exercise and its Legacy
[https://warontherocks.com/2015/11/millennium-challenge-the-real-story-of-a-corrupted-military-exercise-and-its-legacy/]

I’m not going to talk too much about this, beyond recommending giving it a full read. I mentioned some of it at the start of the
newsletter, but these kinds of true tales of institutional capture unfortunately cost lives and end careers — and not always that
of the negligent party. The capture can be summed up in this section: “JFCOM and the Office of the Secretary of Defense were
determined to validate the principles and concepts that would support the advanced technological military transformation that
Rumsfeld and his senior aides had been insisting upon.”

Capture takes place over time, and capture takes place when ones priorities, values, and sensibilities are subsumed by another
force. It also often happens to incredibly smart, talented, and dedicated people who could know better, but whose scope of
potential futures have narrowed.

GLOBAL DESIGN JOBS
Business Design in ChinaFrog Strategist in Shanghai [https://www.frogdesign.com/careers/jobs/1993014]Located in Shanghai

Awesome job for a design-minded business person or a recent MBA grad with Chinese language skills. Frog does incredible work and
attracts incredible talent, so I’ve zero doubt that working with their teams in Shanghai would be an absolutely unreal experience.

Human Centered ImmigrationHuman Centered Design at US Citizen and Immigration Services
[https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/565188500]Located in Washington DC

This is a GS14 (so pretty high up) civil servant position with the Department of Homeland Security’s Citizen and Immigration
Services. There’s a lot of justifiably strong feelings about DHS, but it’s important to remember that DHS is a hodgepodge of
different agencies bundled together after 9/11, and while it does include the much reviled Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(ICE) teams who have been negatively empowered in the current administration, it also includes the coast guard and USCIS. I’d
encourage exploring this option and seeing what change you can make inside. Don’t hesitate to send me a note at alb@andrewlb.com
if this is of interest, and I can try to help you navigate the application.

photography from the West African Ebola Crisis of 2014 won the Pullitzer prize, and captured an horrifying regional crisis. I’ve
been both reading more broadly but also searching for photography of the current pandemic trying to wrap my head around the chaos
others are experiencing relative to the calm (save for a wonderful but berserk 1yr old) of my day-to-day in Denmark. I’d seen
Berehulak’s photos before, but spent some more time with them while writing this. Please give them a look here

Julia Moisand-Egea [https://divergeweekly.com/static/37eb5742114e1cdb86023438b2c6a554/1c72d/julia.jpg]JULIA MOISAND-EGEA
Head of Design, Nordea

Julia is an incredible design leader who I first met in San Francisco. Originally from France and married to an American, she
worked with my wife, Ayla, at Adaptive Path before its acquisition in Capital One. She mentored and supported many emerging
designers before and after that transition, and left an incredible legacy of support with that team. She’s also the catalyst for
our ending up in Copenhagen, as she helped start the Fjord Copenhagen studio and quite effectively recruited Ayla to move to
Europe in early 2017.

Julia is a model of what a global designer can be: someone with experience and empathy across cultures and language, co-designing
a space for herself and her family where there are interesting problems and opportunities. I’ve been hugely inspired watching her
cultivate design communities wherever she goes, and the fact that her team members will move around the world for the chance to
work with her again is a testament to what great design leadership looks like.

https://divergeweekly.com/issue/6/ [https://divergeweekly.com/issue/6/]Diverge Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice.
Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
