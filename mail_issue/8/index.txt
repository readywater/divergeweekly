Everyone I talk to lately is tired.

For those of us in countries with a nominal “flattened” curve, it feels like like we’ve climbed up to a ledge to find a temporary
respite, with the knowledge that we can’t stay here too long. Those experiencing still uncontrolled outbreaks (the idea of control
itself is dubious) only have the belief that a ledge might be close by — without much thought for where one goes next. Either way,
we find ourselves stuck, unsure of how to get down safely or keep going forward. And this is an experience that everyone is
independently living.

DSCF7731 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/b5f4e135fd680c0c143e8b5632fa9013/1c72d/DSCF7731.jpg]The impact of uncertainty on stress [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/%0Ahow-uncertainty-fuels-anxiety/388066/] 
is something that is often obvious and widely acknowledged, but still insidious. We might dismiss a friend’s inquiry into our well
being with a “Things are good” or “I’m fine” not because we feel that way, but simply because it’s the ingrained default. The
construct of normalcy around us — whatever that normal might be — drives our behaviours until those norms are no longer load
bearing.

I think we’re hitting that point where the erosion of localized norms is beginning to undermine the foundations they were built
on. The Prussian military scholar Clausewitz (I’m a security studies student, what do you expect?) has this idea of Friction
[http://www.strategybydesign.org/friction]— the accumulation of little unknowns and events that undermine “the plan.” Clausewitz
argues that a path to victory in war is managing the relative friction between various combatants: reduce your own friction and
increase the enemies. The ubiquitous American MQ-9 Reaper drone is an example of something that amplifies an enemy’s friction
(“Where the hell is that buzzing coming from?”) and reduces allies friction (“Eyes in the sky”). But we don’t have a Reaper drone
for our current situation.

DSCF7674 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/a845729bdf9bf18b5035318eae9fe54c/1c72d/DSCF7674.jpg]Instead of other humans, we are
engaged in a species-wide war of friction against a virus. Covid-19 is a particularly friction-producing bastard. Its slow
incubation timed and high infection rate allowed it to slip past our virological Maginot line, and emergency measures have been
the result. By staying home and keeping physically distant, we’re doing something to balance those scales: the virus can’t spread
what it can’t reach, and even if it does, it can’t spread far within an isolated household. This creates friction for the virus
and we’re starting to see the results — Angela Merkel’s explanation of the effect of friction on the virus’ spread
[https://www.vox.com/2020/4/17/%0A21225916/coronavirus-in-germany-angela-merkel-lifting-lockdown] being perhaps the best framing
of the impact that we can have.

But still our norms are eroding. My wife, son, and I had a picnic in the park this weekend with some friends. They sat two meters
away and we commented on how weird it was. It was also an absolutely incredible relief and utterly surreal at the same time.

There’s a New Yorker article that came out this week called Abandoned
[https://www.newyorker.com/%0Amagazine/2020/04/27/americas-abandonment-of-syria]. It explores the American abandonment of the
Syrian Democratic Forces — a mostly Kurdish force responsible for the defeat of ISIS in Syria and long-time ally of the US. The
entire thing is worth your time, but the section on the re-habitation of Raqqa stood out for the dynamism with which people were
trying to reclaim their lives. Wiring electricity for light and television, planting a garden, cleaning the debris as best they
can. In shattered buildings, families are doing whatever they can do reclaim the shape of normal, but will never see those
previous lives.

The human impact of the Syrian civil war and our current battle with covid-19 can’t and shouldn’t be compared, but it points to
what happens when our foundations are torn from us: we establish new ones. New norms come slowly and with pain, but they do come.
Often, design (particularly interaction design) looks at eliminating friction as completely as it can, but sometimes friction can
beneficial results. An example is the IKEA effect [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect], which shows that people tend to
over-value things they create — like building Ikea furniture.

DSCF7853 [https://divergeweekly.com/static/9c9081053de75fcc8193180e733644cf/1c72d/DSCF7853.jpg]The friends I met in the park had
shared how they’d taught themselves to make bagels, how they were looking after a sick friend from a distance, and how they’d
rediscovered their playstation. Anecdotally, everyone seems to be making sourdough — the shortage of dry yeast in grocery stories
spurring folk to discover that yeast that is constantly floating around us. In the book Wild Ones [https://amzn.to/2Sgs8Rr], Jon
Mooallem explores the idea of shifting baselines relative to generational norm setting — what we understand as “normal” isn’t the
normal for our children or those geographically dispersed. But what we’re experiencing now is this shift at a much more dramatic
speed.

Writing this newsletter each week has — for me — been a bit like that act of making sourdough or bagels in reaction to those
shifting baselines. It’s a manifestation of my own labour and allows me to meditate a bit on what each week or sequence of weeks
feels like — from my own perch in Copenhagen working as a product designer and manager, from the news and articles I read from
around the world, and from the people I talk to across timezones. We are all incrementally building new norms — some of us under
incredible stress and risk, others from a position of privilege. And perhaps the confluence of those new norms — and the friction
they create for the coronavirus’ spread — will create a more resilient world on the other side.

STEPHANIE NGUYEN
Designer and Research Scientist, MIT Media Lab

I worked with Stephanie at the US Digital Service back in 2016. She was an incredibly skilled and experienced designer then, but
since then she joined the Harvard Kennedy School and got her Masters of Public Policy — joining the MIT Media Lab as a research
scientist focused on data privacy.

Steph’s work is worth exploring — she’s proven to be both an incredible convener of talent while also a producer of insightful
work herself. Give her portfolio a look and keep an eye open for her impact on the world of design and privacy.

[https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/lifestyle-culture/article/3081484/coronavirus-japans-onsen-provide-virtual-reality]The ways that
different cultures and communities simulate a lost experience is worth watching, because the simulation might become the
experience itself before long.

South AsiaInside the world’s biggest lockdown [https://overcast.fm/+WEGkNqmuU]Today Explained is a fantastic podcast, and this episode
explores some of the stories and systems behind India’s lockdown. The migration trigger is worth noting.

AmericasQuestions over Kim’s health highlight intelligence limits [https://apnews.com/6368f572177f6c546a7b709aa2ad205f]The speculation in
American intelligence circles on the current state of Kim Jong Un’s health is significant, especially as diplomatic and military
personnel prepare for a potentially seismic change in Korean/US relations.

implementing a slow re-opening as well, but people seem anxious. The reports near the end of the article of increased crime and
overbearing policing is worrying.

Foreign Policy: The Next Pandemic Might Not Be Natural
[https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/20/coronavirus-pandemic-bioterrorism-preparedness/]

Max Brooks is a favourite author of mine. World War Z is a book I’ve re-read about 10 times as a kind of comfort food, and it’s
one of the best pieces of speculative fiction I’ve encountered. I regularly recommend it to students and colleagues alike. This
article is a fantastic look by an expert at global security threat of bioterrorism, and how in some ways, our learning from the
coronavirus pandemic may help ward off potentially greater threats down the road.

GLOBAL DESIGN JOBS
Innovation in the DRCInnovations Advisor, Ideas 42 [https://ideas42.applytojob.com/apply/jqAGdysQBX/Innovations-Advisor]Located in Kinshasa, Congo

This looks like an awesome two year contract position for a service design or design research focused individual. You’ll need to
be authorized to work in the DRC. It looks like a 1-2 year work visa can be applied for, so might be worth asking if the contract
facilitates that process!

Humanitarian CommsMedia and Comms Generalist, Australian Red Cross
[https://probonoaustralia.com.au/jobs/2020/04/media-communications-generalist-aid-worker-2/]Located in International

This is a comms generalist job that’d suit a comms, graphic, or service designer looking to get field experience. Though the job
posting didn’t state where you’d be deployed, it would be a field position and a great way to develop that experience.

We find a lot of our postings on the incredible Design Gigs for Good

tried this kind of thing (Cisco, Oblong Industries, etc), but this one has a particularly human and these days, particularly
appealing skin on it. Worth keeping an eye on!

[https://divergeweekly.com/issue/8/]Diverge Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice.
Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
