Hello 👋,

Welcome to the Diverge Weekly, a newsletter on design around the world. Every week, we take a global perspective on what happened and is happening in people's lives, and in how design is and isn't changing things for the better.

You're busy and you're already informed. You might be a consulting UX designer, or a product manager at a startup. You might be a civil servant at a government agency who is design curious, or serving in your country's military and looking for opportunities to think divergently. There's a lot going on though, so think of the Diverge Weekly as a **launching pad for developing a global design literacy.**

Every week, we'll take a look at what's happening around the globe and where our current definitions of design — **service, systemic, interaction, industrial, etc** — intersect and perhaps intervene. Sometimes we look at how design is failing us, like how a [myopic focus on one setting for design interventions in refugee communities can blind us to better options](https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/18/dont-design-shelter-refugees-kilian-kleinschmidt-rene-boer-good-design-bad-world/). Other times, [we'll look to how designers go out of their way to surface others' stories and change their own narrative in the process](https://medium.com/design-voices/instructed-to-fear-meeting-refugees-seeking-home-697017e3b125).

**Our goal is to look through a regional and critical lens at what design is and where it has purchase.** We believe that sometimes great design is happening when the word "design" is never mentioned, so be patient with us when we share a link that might seem out of left field. We specifically focus on people and collectives within regions. We try not to focus on the action of a nation as the primary agent on the international stage, but rather emphasize the actions, creations, and agency of people, collectives, and organizations. Fundamentally, we think that makes the world a much more interesting place.

Thank you so much for joining and [don't hesitate to send us a note](mailto:hello@divergeweekly.com),

Andrew
