Hi all,

This will be a quick one relative to some of the essays I’ve been writing recently.

I’ve been reading and thinking about foresight — especially as it relates to the current pandemic and security. As a result, I’ve been getting interested in the human-made inevitability of prediction and wanted to explore that briefly.

With the rise of platform empires, we’ve effectively [ceded the original vision of the internet as a distributed space](https://anildash.com/2012/12/13/the_web_we_lost/). Battle after battle of the free internet was lost to convenience, monetization strategies that drove consolidation, and **the pens, mice, and post-its of designers locked in market-driven competition**. Some of the most interesting conversations one can have on this are with Facebook designers who are both critical thinkers (which applies to many of those I’ve met) and who are anxious about the impact of what they’ve helped create. Yet they find themselves captured through unvested stock, individual loyalties within their teams, and the completely legitimate hypothesis that they might be able to make things better.

I don’t really know the answer on this one. [We’re all culpable for the internet that we lost](https://thenextweb.com/eu/2017/06/09/pirate-bay-founder-weve-lost-the-internet-its-all-about-damage-control-now/), and there’s some very good designers at the platform giants — good in skill and good in soul — who we shouldn’t throw under the bus. But I do think there’s a meaningful discussion to be had around this idea of capture and recognizing when we ARE captured.

I read an article recently by Patrick Porter on [how the British national security apparatus undermined its own foresight efforts by unconsciously insisting on confidence in their capacity to handle whatever might come](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-international-security/article/taking-uncertainty-seriously-classical-realism-and-national-security/1022E6B6D12A8902E7F40B575D01C40B). This very idea is pathological: that they might both acknowledge the magnitude of the unknowns they faced, and still feel require confidence that we can wrangle it given our current preparedness. Britain isn’t alone in this, of course. If you’re developing a product, you’ll experience microcosms of this every day: the feature or design decision you made just doesn’t glom on to reality. Your user or customer is frustrated, their user or customers are confused — all because your synthesis of their needs and your own sensibility missed its mark. The difference lies in the speed of iteration.

A designer can (usually) quite easily test their hypothesis. Find a customer, set up a prototype, launch a test, or simply watch how your (possibly socially distanced) neighbour interacts with it. But of course it’s not so easy for a state’s national security establishment. Usually, national security institutions are pretty brilliant when it comes to punching through their own biases, using tools like [red teaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team) and others to explore alternative scenarios. But as [Micah Zenko’s book on Red Teaming points out](https://amzn.to/3aaWM4X) , the role of the Red Team can often be institutionally undermined in subtle ways: [be it explicitly walking back a decision during a war game](https://warontherocks.com/2015/11/millennium-challenge-the-real-story-of-a-corrupted-military-exercise-and-its-legacy/) or [tacitly signalling leadership’s dissatisfaction with the results](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/07/red-team-a-tale-of-how-a-general-didnt-listen-to-internal-criticism-in-afghanistan/). In both cases, the act of simulating alternative options — of diverging from the current mode of thought — becomes dramatically constrained by the needs and fears of the commissioning institutions. It’s effectively nullified.

I think the same thing happens to the sensibility of designers captured by institutions. The scope of potential divergence becomes naturally constrained by the needs of the institutions they serve, and so their sensibility [is reinforced and narrowed along those lines over time](https://divergeweekly.com/issue/4/). And I think this is part of what I want Diverge Weekly to combat. This capture is a reflection of a point in time for an individual or a class of designers where the aperture is narrowing. But I’d like to believe it can still be opened.

So if the intent is to widen that aperture, functionally how do we start to open it again?

That’ll be for future issues.

**Daniel Berehulak**'s photography from the West African Ebola Crisis of 2014 won the Pullitzer prize, and captured an horrifying regional crisis. I’ve been both reading more broadly but also searching for photography of the current pandemic trying to wrap my head around the chaos others are experiencing relative to the calm (save for a wonderful but berserk 1yr old) of my day-to-day in Denmark. I’d seen Berehulak’s photos before, but spent some more time with them while writing this.

<voices who="Julia Moisand Egea" role="Head of Design, Nordea" image="img/julia.jpg">

Julia is an incredible design leader who I first met in San Francisco. Originally from France and married to an American, she worked with my wife, Ayla, at Adaptive Path before its acquisition in Capital One. She mentored and supported many emerging designers before and after that transition, and left an incredible legacy of support with that team. She’s also the catalyst for our ending up in Copenhagen, as she helped start the Fjord Copenhagen studio and quite effectively recruited Ayla to move to Europe in early 2017.

Julia is a model of what a global designer can be: someone with experience and empathy across cultures and language, co-designing a space for herself and her family where there are interesting problems and opportunities. I’ve been hugely inspired watching her cultivate design communities wherever she goes, and the fact that her team members will move around the world for the chance to work with her again is a testament to what great design leadership looks like.
