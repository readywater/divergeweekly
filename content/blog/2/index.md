Hello from a shuttered Denmark,

This past week we've seen the “exponential” part of exponential growth hit the world like a tidal wave. Markets have dipped, businesses are scrambling, and the people that constitute both are unsure of what’s coming.

What we’ve seen with this global crisis is a failure in planning, and for those of us who are designers, planning is our business. At its core, **Design is a time-delayed activity**: one where we engage with people and systems to plot out a path to a better future using artifacts and experiences. In this pandemic, we’re instead seeing a reversion. Far from having planned redundancies and designed for resiliency, we’re instead facing the stark fragility of a system co-designed with agents of unchecked growth and profit.

In this definition of design, we have two key components: foresight and intervention.

**Foresight** asks: what is needed in the future? Why do we believe this? What needs to happen for that to exist? What else might happen?
On a systemic and world-spanning extreme, the peak of this practice is in world-building fiction. Books like [Max Brooks’ World War Z](https://amzn.to/2TR3O9Z) and [Liu Cixin’s The Dark Forest](https://amzn.to/33jAs79) both take a worldly and step-by-step approach to exploring human behaviour and outcomes given distinct conditions: for World War Z, a global zombie pandemic; and for the Dark Forest, an impending apocalypse and humanity’s instinct to flee, fight, or simply give up.

For the nearer term, the designer has a host of tools available, from [card games like those created by Near Future Lab](https://nearfuturelaboratory.myshopify.com/products/design-fiction-product-design-work-kit) for generating scenarios, and structured “gap filling” tools like [backcasting](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249060842_Backcasting_-_A_framework_for_for_strategic_planning) to map the pathway to the preferable outcomes. But at best, foresight samples and extrapolates from the potential territories that we march toward, and informs the context and constraints of our design activities.

On the other end is **intervention**. With the current coronavirus outbreak, the rhetorical focus has very much been on POLICY interventions: how can we wield the apparatus of states to tackle a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem) like a global pandemic? For examples of this discussion, [there’s a great episode of Vox’s The Weeds](https://megaphone.link/VMP2383267901) on the American policy response, and [Vox’s global affairs podcast Worldly has an additional North American-centric exploration of outcomes and implications as well](https://megaphone.link/VMP2017093543).

But we’re also seeing an active response in how design engages with the crisis. As Malcom McCullough points out in his book Digital Ground, “The success of a design is arrived at socially.” Across China —an already incredibly sophisticated and integrated surveillance state— software serves to mitigate, inform, but also surveil. [Chinese public-private partnerships have led to a colour-code based access system to public space](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html), with quite legitimate concerns for social acceptance of surveillance post-pandemic. South Korea is taking a similar intervention with a different implementation — [free drive through testing in your car with a simple text-message based notification of your results](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/815441078/south-koreas-drive-through-testing-for-coronavirus-is-fast-and-free) which allows testing infrastructure to be incredibly light weight in a country where two-thirds of people own a car. In other words, we are seeing “crisis architecture” churn through society once more: the [modular hospitals in Wuhan](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-building-1000-bed-hospital-over-the-weekend-to-treat-coronavirus) being in the same family as [post-9/11 segmentation of America’s airports](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-32-design-for-airports/).

Clearly, design has a role in this crisis, but how does the individual designer engage? The most useless thing I’ve read about the coronavirus was this [list of how design thinking is going to save us from coronavirus](https://fortune.com/2020/01/28/the-coronavirus-problem-could-be-solved-by-design-thinking/). If you’re a “design thinker” only asking these questions now, you’ve already failed. The examples in China and South Korea are an adaptive strategy with an adaptive design to a fast moving crisis that came from either excellent foresight activities (taking a more strategic approach) or simply learning the hard way (the more intuitive approach). As such, the context for an appropriate design to emerge, succeed, and hopefully obviate its utility already exists, as we’re already seeing with the [1000 bed hospital in Wuhan being disassembled](https://archpaper.com/2020/03/wuhan-shutters-all-temporary-hospitals-covid-19-risk-dissipates/).

As we collectively weather this pandemic, the thing we should recognize is that foresight without intervention is simply speculation, and intervention without foresight is [naive at best](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22453746) and [incredibly harmful at worst](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/12/814876173/coronavirus-trump-speech-creates-chaos-eu-says-it-wasnt-warned-of-travel-ban). As those working in or adjacent to design, we have a responsibility to look ahead: both systematically using the tools of our trade, and ambiantly by absorbing information globally and from many sources.

Be safe and by generous. Finally, look after yourself now, because like everyone’s favourite William Gibson quote, “The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” [Just as China is finding itself able to respond to Italy’s needs](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/coronavirus-china-sends-medical-aid-to-spain-and-italy) because of how it handled its own spike in infections, we all might be in a position to help others depending on where we are in our own infection curve.

That’s it for this week. As always, I’d encourage you to [subscribe](https://divergeweekly.com) if you haven’t and [send me a note](mailto:alb@andrewlb.com) if you have questions or feedback!

|I found it valuable to revisit this article from 2018, when there were cries to learn from the risk inherent to the most recent Ebola outbreaks. There is no guarantee that we will learn from this crisis, and so we must do what we can to build a personal pattern-recognition for the leading signs and signals of our next crisis.

|[Coronavirus burial pits so vast they’re visible from space](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/iran-coronavirus-outbreak-graves/)
|Already having faced incredible internal upheaval in January, Iran has been brutally affected by the coronavirus, evidenced by the digging of mass graves near Qom. The societal scars of poor foresight, maladapted systems, and just bad luck will be with us for decades; and Iran will be an important place to watch for social adaptation post-crisis.

|This is an older article, but an interesting one to surface. The infrastructure of personal hygiene is always an issue in public health, and one which we readily take for granted. This article digs into the affordances and cues we need to keep in mind to adhere to protective hygiene in this era, and might be a useful tool for those of you thinking of setting something up for your community or building.

|Dutch designer and forecaster Li Edelkoort weighs in on the possibility of an economic "reset" from coronavirus, especially with regards to globalization of certain local commodities (she uses the example of saris made in China and imported to India, which have disrupted local design markets).

[Google denies link to China’s military over touch-screen tools that may help PLA pilots](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3017141/google-denies-link-chinas-military-over-touch-screen-tools-may)

An interesting look at how consumer UX expectations bleed into critical military and defence applications. Having been a product designer at the Pentagon myself, I can generally say that the state of military UX is pretty dismal EXCEPT for when it is mission critical. In a culture obsessed with Job Boyd's OODA loop, speed and efficiency for warfighters is a strong argument. Seeing how that is playing out in other militaries, I wonder if UX will become yet another front in great power competition.

|Located in Turkey
|Amnesty International is looking for a researcher to report on human rights issues in Turkey and the surrounding region. While this appears to be a more traditional research role, and less of a design-centric one, I think it could serve as a fascinating bridge for a design researcher to transition their values and viewpoint into the policy space. In particular, emphasizing empathy and qualitative methods in your application would go a long way!

<voices who="Fahmida Azad" role="Acting Head of Education, CIID">
Fahmida is a fascinating designer. I facilitated a workshop with her in Copenhagen, and got to see her methods for fusing critical discourse with design talent. She's a Bangladeshi-American service designer with experience working in education and NGOs around the world, including time spent in Palestine and Jordan. These days, she's leading education for the IDP program at Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design and giving awesome talks at Interaction 20.
