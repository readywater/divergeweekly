Hello 👋,

Welcome to Diverge Weekly, a newsletter taking a critical look at design and world affairs. Every week, we take a global
perspective on events shaping human experience, and consider how design is and isn’t changing things for the better.

You’re busy and you’re already informed. You might be a traveling UX researcher, a student wondering when you can take your studio
work to the world, or a product manager juggling a dozen priorities. You might be a civil servant at a government agency who is
design curious, or serving in your country’s military and looking for ways to think and problem solve divergently. There’s a lot
going on though, so think of Diverge Weekly as a launching pad for developing your own global design literacy.

Every week, we’ll take a look at what’s happening around the globe and where our current definitions of design — service,
systemic, interaction, industrial, etc — intersect and perhaps intervene in people’s lived experiences with world affairs.
Sometimes we look at how design is failing us, like how a myopic focus on one context for design interventions in refugee
communities can blind us to better options

times, we’ll look to how designers go out of their way to surface others’ stories and change their own narrative in the process

Our goal is to look through a regional and critical lens at what design is and where it is rooted. We believe that sometimes great
design is happening when the word “design” is never mentioned, so be patient with us when we share a link that might seem out of
left field. Specifically, we focus on people and collectives within regions, and try not to focus on the action of a nation as the
primary agent on the international stage. Rather, we emphasize the actions, creations, and agency of people, collectives, and
organizations. Fundamentally, we think that makes the world a much more interesting place.

Thank you so much for joining and don’t hesitate to send us a note [hello@divergeweekly.com].

See you on Wednesday,

Andrew

Design practice has a deep capacity to reveal the unseen and to affect our behaviour, the systems we rely on, and the outcomes we
collectively experience. 

Diverge Weekly takes a critical global perspective in how design emerges from different localities, and how our design decisions
converge to impact and influence the lives of those around the world.
