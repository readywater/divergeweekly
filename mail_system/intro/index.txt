AND DESIGNERS THROUGH THE LENS OF GLOBAL AFFAIRS.
ISSUE #0: WELCOME TO DIVERGE WEEKLY

Hello 👋,

THANK YOU FOR SIGNING UP!
Welcome to Diverge Weekly, a newsletter looking at design and global affairs. Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible
products, thoughtful interfaces: we want to help you make sense of what is happening around the world and empower you to
participate.

You’re busy and you’re already informed. You might be a UX researcher fascinated by people, a design student wondering when you
can take your studio work to the world, or a product manager juggling a dozen priorities. You might be a civil servant at a
government agency who is design curious, or serving in your country’s military and looking for ways to think and problem solve
divergently. There’s a lot going on though, so think of Diverge Weekly as a launching pad for developing your own global design
literacy.

Every week, we’ll take a look at what’s happening around the globe and where our current definitions of design — service,
systemic, interaction, industrial, etc — intersect and perhaps intervene in people’s lived experiences with world affairs.
Sometimes we look at how design is failing us, like how a myopic focus on one context for design interventions in refugee
communities can blind us to better options
[https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/18/dont-design-shelter-refugees-kilian-kleinschmidt-rene-boer-good-design-bad-world/]. Other
times, we’ll look to how designers go out of their way to surface others’ stories and change their own narrative in the process
[https://medium.com/design-voices/instructed-to-fear-meeting-refugees-seeking-home-697017e3b125].

We want to provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.

Thank you so much for joining and don’t hesitate to send us a note [hello@divergeweekly.com].

See you on Wednesday,

Andrew

[https://divergeweekly.com/system/intro/]Diverge Weekly is a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design practice.
Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric and
systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

Our goal: provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.
