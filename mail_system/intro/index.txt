Hello 👋,

Welcome to Diverge Weekly, a newsletter exploring design in a global context, outside of the familiar western lens on design
practice. Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: these emerge where person-centric
and systems-oriented sensibility combine with a practice of making things tangible.

You’re busy and you’re already informed. You might be a traveling UX researcher, a student wondering when you can take your studio
work to the world, or a product manager juggling a dozen priorities. You might be a civil servant at a government agency who is
design curious, or serving in your country’s military and looking for ways to think and problem solve divergently. There’s a lot
going on though, so think of Diverge Weekly as a launching pad for developing your own global design literacy.

Every week, we’ll take a look at what’s happening around the globe and where our current definitions of design — service,
systemic, interaction, industrial, etc — intersect and perhaps intervene in people’s lived experiences with world affairs.
Sometimes we look at how design is failing us, like how a myopic focus on one context for design interventions in refugee
communities can blind us to better options
[https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/18/dont-design-shelter-refugees-kilian-kleinschmidt-rene-boer-good-design-bad-world/]. Other
times, we’ll look to how designers go out of their way to surface others’ stories and change their own narrative in the process
[https://medium.com/design-voices/instructed-to-fear-meeting-refugees-seeking-home-697017e3b125].

We want to provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice by curating jobs, stories, and context with a
lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT
traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led
impact.

Thank you so much for joining and don’t hesitate to send us a note [hello@divergeweekly.com].

See you on Wednesday,

Andrew
