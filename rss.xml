Somehow they must process immense quantities of information—concerning the tastes and incomes of consumers, the outputs and costs of producers, future products and methods of production, and the myriad of interdependences of all of the above. The task of gathering this information, let alone making sense of it, is beyond any designing intelligence. But it is not beyond the market, which yields ‘spontaneous order’ out of chaos. — The Economist&apos;s obituary to Friedrich Hayek&quot;&gt;&lt;span

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re likely at home, or I hope you are able to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://divergeweekly.com/issue/2/&quot;&gt;I wrote about the balance of intervention and foresight&lt;/a&gt; in a design-based response to the coronavirus pandemic, and closed with the William Gibson quote “The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” We are all experiencing Covid-19 on different schedules and scales, with Italy being the most egregious case and with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/24/trump-wants-to-restart-economy-by-mid-april-146398&quot;&gt;America marching blindly into its wake&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;This means that our individual construction of the future in this pandemic is relative to our own experience and belief about the future&lt;/em&gt;, and that relativism is the focus of this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are three ways that I see this being constructed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An act of Apprehension&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in Denmark right now, and writing this on Saturday, March 21st. My wife, my one year-old son, and I have been self-isolating for 10 days, as have many of our friends. We were early in preparing for this lockdown, and this apprehension is a judgement of risk relative to the array of possible futures at the point of decision, and making a “best guess” for which set of possibilities we should prepare. We might have felt pretty dumb pulling our son from daycare a few days early if things had turned out fine, but since &lt;a href=&quot;https://andrewlb.com/writing/remotework/&quot;&gt;I’ve worked remotely for two years now&lt;/a&gt; we had the right tools and support set up so that the cost of being wrong was effectively my son joining a few video meetings and my exhaustion. Ultimately, an act of apprehension can go either way, and is a gamble on trying to position oneself along a more preferable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An act of Mitigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only yesterday, my university in the UK announced that they were closing the school and modifying distance courses: despite the fact that by percentage of the population, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cream.io/?m=tcpp&amp;#x26;r=United%20States%2C-45&amp;#x26;r=Italy%2C-35&amp;#x26;r=South%20Korea%2C-31&amp;#x26;r=Denmark%2C-45&amp;#x26;r=United%20Kingdom%2C-45&amp;#x26;s=log&amp;#x26;z=3&quot;&gt;the UK has a higher rate of cases than Denmark&lt;/a&gt; – even with Denmark being in lock down for over a week. As cases and deaths grow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-myth-economy-uk-business-life-death&quot;&gt;PM Johnson’s reactions have been compared to that of the Mayor in Jaws&lt;/a&gt;, keeping the beach open for tourist season despite a murderous shark in its waters. Here then, our action and judgement is responsive to independent variables and driven by the same. Apprehension may drive our consumption of information, but the action of mitigation is only to offset damage that is already being done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An act of Ignorance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most worrisome trends are where no action is being taken at all or the threat is seen as negligible. In Denmark, I was shocked to see folk pushing past each other while grocery shopping and the school closure being seen as an excuse to party, not shelter. This aligns with the stories of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-51955362/us-students-party-on-spring-break-despite-coronavirus&quot;&gt;American students congregating on beaches for spring break&lt;/a&gt;, or worse, &lt;a href=&quot;https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,bolsonaro-tem-contato-direto-com-ao-menos-272-pessoas-durante-ato-mostra-video,70003234397&quot;&gt;exposure by those attending the rallies of Brazilian president Bolsonaro&lt;/a&gt;. This route is either willful or unintended: resulting from a dearth of information or — worst of all — given the information available, doing nothing or doing harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with these three actions is that they reflect an inflection point that is being considered by everyone: informed by their lived experience, their state of mind, societal pressures, and access to resources. My decision to self isolate 10 days ago might have occurred at the same moment in time as someone’s decision that spring break was a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these decisions and actions have vital influence on our future and the outcomes we march towards. Design futurist Stuart Candy is well known for his Cone of Possibility, a rendering of the present squeezing a series of potential futures through its aperture. The question is: when does the future catch up and which set of actions lead us to what is preferable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we’re looking at the longer tail of this crisis, apprehension, mitigation, and ignorance might not be all that different in terms of collective outcomes, but they ARE decisions that we make. This pandemic is a collective action problem: individual actions might offset or buffer one from the worst (or in the case of the spring breakers, drastically increase their own and others’ risk), the aggregate outcome is still likely to be the same. But then the question is, at what scale?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If individual action is smoothed over from the lens of the aggregate action or inaction of others, then I would argue that the route to designing an intervention is to &lt;em&gt;identify the scale and scope of intervention&lt;/em&gt; so that ones actions have an outsized effect. Is it the country? The state? The community? The family?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/PubInv/covid19-vent-list&quot;&gt;the open source community’s effort to expand access to life-saving ventilators&lt;/a&gt;. We don’t actually know yet if this work will do anything particularly productive, but it is a fervent and well-organized effort to try and do something with the scope that one has. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dm4mb/people-are-trying-to-make-diy-ventilators-to-meet-coronavirus-demand&quot;&gt;There are dangers and risks&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps the communal contribution at the appropriate scope can cover that, and perhaps this can multiply the impact at a local level in communities with maker spaces or universities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we may be trapped at a point in a cone hurtling towards a future we can’t really comprehend, I’d argue that we — designers and design-adjacent creators engaged in a practice that is fundamentally participatory — are incredibly well situated to identify our scope of impact and organize around it. Design might not have a “seat at the table” (I hate this term so, so much) when it comes to policy-decisions right now, but we can contribute and organize locally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look to &lt;a href=&quot;https://covidto.glideapp.io/&quot;&gt;Zahra Ebrahim’s Covid-19 Toronto app&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18IAn2bwZeYj2Oy9TdGCO8wB3w3lv3wnLMpyzEYFfWDI/edit&quot;&gt;google doc that she coordinated to bring it all together&lt;/a&gt;. As a leader in Toronto’s design community, she turned to her network to identify the needs and resources of her home, but with a designer’s person-centred bias created something of real value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zahra’s work might shift Toronto’s future in a particular way, and if that process can be replicated ten thousand fold around the world, our family, community, state, country, and civilizational outcomes will be be so much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the future isn’t evenly distributed, how might we distribute the right future more evenly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that note, my wife and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://andrewlb.com/writing/anxietygame/&quot;&gt;created a very bleak, no-fun game to try a predict and prepare for potential futures&lt;/a&gt; this past weekend. It’s a &lt;strong&gt;simulator and scenario generator for what might come —for you, specifically— in this pandemic&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite being a game, as my description of our first play-through indicates, the results were exhausting (but useful). I encourage you to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, &lt;a href=&quot;https://divergeweekly.com&quot;&gt;please subscribe to and share Diverge Weekly&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t and &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:alb@andrewlb.com&quot;&gt;send me a note&lt;/a&gt; if you have questions or feedback!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;&lt;region&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;Americas&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2020/03/21/trudeau-urges-canadians-to-avoid-travel-to-other-provinces.html&quot;&gt;Self-isolate and practice social distancing or the government will force you to, Health Minister warns&lt;/a&gt;
Canada is in a challenging position. Widely distributed with provincially-managed healthcare, the response to the pandemic is likely to be unevenly distributed and difficult. This threat to exercise federal power is coming as countries around the world do the same. In your own country, look for the use of police or military force being applied as an executive supplement to healthcare services as a “sign” of this expanded mandate in a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;MENA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/has-the-coronavirus-reached-syria-1.70539898&quot;&gt;Has the coronavirus reached Syria?&lt;/a&gt;
Covid-19 is an extreme threat to existing power structures: both physically and politically. As seen in Iran, certainly it can infect those in power, but it also undermines their power base depending on how they handle the crisis. The various Syrian civil war facitons are now dealing with the potential of an influx of cases, and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;East Asia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://observers.france24.com/en/20200305-south-korea-coronavirus-COVID-19-kits-masks&quot;&gt;South Korea’s COVID-19 quarantine kits&lt;/a&gt;
The artifacts of a country’s policy decision are always fascinating, and the current pandemic is no exception. This article takes a look at how articles of hygiene are distributed in the environment, and provided to those identified as infected. Given South Korea’s success in combatting the virus, it’s worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;South Asia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/pakistan-coronavirus-camp-no-facilities-no-humanity&quot;&gt;Pakistan coronavirus camp: ‘No facilities, no humanity’&lt;/a&gt;
The architecture and infrastructure of a crisis manifest in different ways. This camp along the border of Iran and Pakistan was hastily erected to quarantine those crossing for the incubation period of two weeks, but its conditions were reported as terrible. What we build on the margins can often bleed inward, and so paying attention to spaces like this, the camps in Syria near Turkey, and distributed around the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/18/ngos-raise-alarm-as-coronavirus-strips-support-from-eu-refugees&quot;&gt;NGOs raise alarm as coronavirus strips support from EU refugees&lt;/a&gt;
Vulnerability often describes a state where ones is unable to face further crisis successfully. An many vulnerable peoples look to Europe for refuge from one crisis, another has suddenly shattered the infrastructure of these potential homes — leaving refugees without infrastructure or resources, and without coherent strategies to manage in their absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/region&gt;&lt;security credit=&quot;Frederick Burr Opper&quot;&gt;&lt;span

Why? They frustrate meaningful engagement in collective action problems like a national political process or — just by way of example — global pandemics. They do this to the point of paralysis. Bellingcat paints a striking picture of what I believe is &lt;strong&gt;one of the greatest design failures of the 21st century&lt;/strong&gt;: the capacity for contemporary disinformation campaigns (and individual actors) to permeate and diffuse the major social networking platforms that so eagerly embraced human centered design in their inception and grwoth. I’m inclined to believe that the various platforms &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; trying to do better (perhaps not so far as good), but assuming this, their inability to effectively combat disnformation is telling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/security&gt;&lt;jobs&gt;&lt;!-- [[featurejob]]

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitch Sinclair is an executive designer director at IDEO and creative director at Palmwood, a collaboration between the United Arab Emirites and IDEO. I met Mitch originally when I was at IDEO Palo Alto, and instantly felt welcome and elevated in how she collaborated, connected, and created. The future-oriented and design-driven work in the UAE has been consistently interesting and worth exploring, so I’d encourage you to take a look at Palmwood and the team Mitch is co-creating in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.palmwood.org/whatwerecreating-en&quot;&gt;What Palmwood is Working On&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/voices&gt;&lt;twitter who=&quot;rebexxxxa&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rebexxxxa/status/1242162412171726850&quot;&gt;what’s your quarantine personality a) animal crossing b) tiktok dances c) baking sourdough d) wine e) doing something stupid to your hair f) crying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/twitter&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;classified&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design is a cyclical action.&lt;/strong&gt; While individual artifacts are ejected from the process (like this newsletter and its upcoming visual redesign), the actual process of design is something ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout my career, I’ve wrestled with the fundamentally commercial nature of design output. We live in a capitalist society, and must create something that someone else sees as being of value to be rewarded within that system. As this system too is cyclical, our reward is fed back into the system to reward others for their production of something that we value. This is the most simplistic of frames, but a good place to start. I quite like how Donella Meadows framed these systems in her book &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2UodGbs&quot;&gt;Thinking in Systems: A primer&lt;/a&gt;.

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design process and ones evolution as a designer manifests in almost the exact same way, but with memory. As designers, we are driven to create artefacts of some value to others. We engage in a cyclical process to create these artefacts and then “freeze” the process in time (as a manufactured object, as a defined version of code, as printed material, as an executed experience) to reflect our understanding of maximized value to the consumer. Then, we either start working on the next version if we’re product focused, the next aspect of the experience if we’re service focused, or something else entirely if we’re consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the process of creating that output, our experience as designers has been altered. By designing something, you engage in a cyclical process of orienting a designed thing alongside the needs and values of a consumer (so you can be rewarded for that thing with capital somehow). What that means is that you situate your process as a designer alongside a market demand, and your process — your identity as a creator — is altered to better adhere to that market. In many ways, you come to be a reflector of those market needs and demands when engaging in design process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This reflection collectively impoverishes the discipline of design.&lt;/strong&gt; By unconsciously aligning our identities with the demands of a capitalist economy, we serve to limit the scope of what might be created by lieu of that allegiance. In my own market-focused product, Knowsi, I struggle with this immensely. The strategic goal of this tool is to alter the behaviours of researchers, so that protecting the privacy rights of their research participants is EASIER than not protecting them. For me, it is more valuable to design a tool that represents my own values around privacy, but for the consumer, it is more valuable to have a tool that maximizes their power in the researcher/participant consent relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see this tension of value everywhere. Today, one of the most intensive debates is around the overreach of the FAANG software companies and their approach to privacy. In his book &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2wJ0Hbi&quot;&gt;Platform Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Srnicek points out that “if these platforms wish to remain competitive, they must intensify their extraction, analysis, and control of data — and they must invest in the fixed capital to do so.” &lt;strong&gt;Designers of these platforms are faced with a potentially excruciating choice: engage with the individual value set of their own design process — one which might value privacy, or one which emphasizes restraint, or one which celebrates sustainability — or engage with the incredibly tangible value set of the market — valuing competitiveness, defensible assets and property, and relative market share.&lt;/strong&gt; This choice is often not as hard as one might think, as we are all often hundreds and thousands of individual design decisions down the path of the market’s frame on value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does one escape this? I actually don’t know that you can. Here are two examples of lock-in: one positive; one negative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A product that I’ve really admired over the past bit is &lt;a href=&quot;https://solarsack.com/&quot;&gt;Solar Sack&lt;/a&gt;, a startup from Denmark’s Innofounder program of which led design mentorship in 2018 and 2019. Solar Sack is a brilliantly designed product. It’s a mechanism to heat water using only solar energy, and it’s cheap, durable, and easy to use. Its customer base is rural Africans in need of a cheaper and more sustainable alternative to burning fuel for heat and purify water. It has a sustainable and profitable business model that isn’t extractive to its customer base, and vitally, the value system of its designer Andreas aligns brilliantly with the value his customers receive from the product. But Alexander has been working on this thing for years. The product emerged from his masters in industrial design, and before that, he had spent time in Kenya working and volunteering. The product itself was vitally co-designed with its users: with Alexander taking multiple extended trips across Africa to work with his potential customers. As such, by the time Solar Sack hit the market, he had been through countless cycles of a design process that oriented his values toward those of his customers, and facilitated the emergence of this product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take an alternative, far larger, and far more tragic example: the US failure to aid and rebuild in Afghanistan. Between the invasion in 2001 and 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/2016/2/26/11116874/afghanistan-failure&quot;&gt;the United States spent more money attempting to rebuild Afghanistan than it spent rebuilding Europe in the wake of World War II&lt;/a&gt;. And yet now in 2020, the Trump administration is in peace negotiations with the Taliban, attempting to retreat from the marginal gains in civil liberty and governance that have been made. With the caveat that any commentary on this failure is both subjective and incredibly generalizing to such a wickedly complex problem, I would make the argument that the challenge lies in a deep misalignment between the value system of the designing entity (the US-led coalition) and what is VALUED by those receiving the aid. Access to capital, development projects, education, and political enfranchisement are certainly great things on the surface, but on what terms? And for whom? In his 2013 article Money Pit, Joel Brinkley recounts examples of failures from the US development in Afghanistan. As the US DOD Government Accountability Office put it, “we noted that without an adequate number of trained oversight personnel, DoD could not be assured that contractors could meet contract requirements efficiently and effectively.” This resulted in such memorable mistakes as a dining hall without a kitchen, a shower facility without plumbing, and a forward operating base built so flimsily, its staircases were a greater threat to US personnel than the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue of oversight in this case is &lt;strong&gt;a failure to receive feedback from ones market&lt;/strong&gt;. If the goal of US aid in Afghanistan is to replicate the modality of reconstruction that Europe saw following World War II through the Marshall Plan, then the necessity of feedback is all the greater. As mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://divergeweekly.com/issue/3/&quot;&gt;quote section of last week’s newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, free market economies thrive on the dissemination and aggregation of information in common pools. The stock market, for example, is believed to be an invaluable aggregator of sentiment and mood within an economy. By the same token, the synthesis of a dozen users interviewed is believed to be a vital aggregation of your customer’s needs and intent. Across the myriad ways that the US aid program in Afghanistan differed from the Marshall plan, those feedback mechanisms are primary. Without effective feedback, how could the US government and its many agencies possibly get to a model of development that reflected the real needs of the Afghan people? And perhaps more fundamentally, is it even possible for an occupying power to provide for those needs given the gap in the occupying power’s value system, and the definition of value held by those occupied?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design is a cyclical and continuous action. We constantly reflect back our observations and actions in the world, and incrementally re-orient our world views over time.&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps my favourite articulation of this is John Boyd’s diagram of the OODA loop, but instead of the microsecond articulation of that loop that Boyd envisioned in arial combat, I imagine it as spread across the entirety of ones life as a designer.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander’s Solar Sack is an output of years of iteration leading him to the creation of that design and that business. The US aid mission in Afghanistan is an output of decades of iteration across hundreds of organizations and thousands of people that locked it into a particular belief about how to accomplish that mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that &lt;strong&gt;the frontier of contemporary design is to find the tools to break out of our shared path dependence.&lt;/strong&gt; Individually and collectively, we’ve become trapped by our own processes, and we need a way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, looking at the sudden shift in value that we’re seeing in the wake of Covid-19, I wonder if perhaps now is the time to question everything. I don’t know that the business model canvas will save us, if only because it presupposes a particular flow of production and value. I don’t really believe that offering “free consulting hours” will help us, especially if consulting around a paradigm that left us this fragile. I think we need to change and look outside of what we thought worked, and I know that won’t be easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But right now, trapped as we are between a brittle past and an uncertain future (probably in our homes, possibly with loud neighbours), what better time to turn the cyclical motion of design in on ourselves, and perhaps shake free of the grooves we’ve found ourselves in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, &lt;a href=&quot;https://divergeweekly.com&quot;&gt;please subscribe to and share Diverge Weekly&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t and &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:alb@andrewlb.com&quot;&gt;send me a note&lt;/a&gt; if you have questions or feedback!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;&lt;region&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;East Asia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dezeen.com/2017/07/01/remodelled-tokyo-home-4-generations-same-family-architecture-residential-japan-multi-generational-homes/&quot;&gt;Tomomi Kito remodels Tokyo home to accommodate four generations of the same family&lt;/a&gt;
Design is a cyclical action, especially in its capacity to generate culture and tradition. Our home is perhaps the most fundamental tool in a shared experience, and to design one intentionally around multiple generations is both a brave and incredibly prescient decision, given how close family structures might help us weather the uncertainty ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;South Asia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/india-links-dozens-coronavirus-cases-muslim-gathering-200331095417048.html&quot;&gt;India tracks attendees after Muslim event linked to virus cases&lt;/a&gt;
Cycles can be destructive. The chipping away by populism and religious violence, the world’s largest democracy is straining under multiple stressors, and covid-19 is only the most recent. Looking at the anti-muslim rhetoric of the Modi administration, it is a major worry that this crisis will turn into a justification for increased surveillance and increased persecution. While many world leaders are finding their position tenuous in these times, most authoritarians will leverage emergency power in the coming weeks, months, and years to secure their position. The question is: can that impulse be controlled by democratic institutions and civil society?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;Americas&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-states-peak-hospitals-53274e0e-69b8-4dc7-b069-fb27955c559a.html&quot;&gt;The coronavirus outbreak won’t peak in every state at once&lt;/a&gt;
The last two issues of Diverge looked at this idea that a common event in time is experienced both subjectively and objectively in very different ways. In this case, we have an incredibly tangible model of how covid-19 will hit its peak in different states, at different points in time. As we saw in the UK (PM Johnson went from recommended herd immunity and handshaking the infected to self isolating) and an unending stream of exponential graphs, that interval between a considered-or-ignored threat and a deadly reality comes far too quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;MENA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/3/31/europe-sends-medical-gear-to-iran-in-sanction-bypass-deal&quot;&gt;Europe sends medical gear to Iran, bypassing US sanctions as coronavirus deaths rise&lt;/a&gt;
Cycles can also be productive. The crippling (and unfortunately fairly innovative) sanctions placed on Iran by the United States are a substantive contributor to the current scale of the covid-19 crisis in Iran. While certainly not the only factor (Iranian government collectively showed up to work with a temperature of 45c and the statement “I feel fine. Is it hot in here?” on their lips), this push against the US sanction regime through a (somewhat) new transaction mode called INSTEX may serve not only as a diplomatic reset with Iran, but as an absolutely vital measure to save Iranian lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;Africa&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/somalia-sending-20-doctors-to-help-italy-fight-virus/1782154&quot;&gt;Somalia sending 20 doctors to help Italy fight virus&lt;/a&gt;
In a world of deep but variate mutual dependence, we should watch for the cycles of stasis or change around the world. African nations are responding to the crisis in different ways and keeping an eye to the shifting power structures between the US and China, partially by pushing against the tired stereotype of being only recipients of aid rather than active participants in a global community. Because our experience of now is by definition only fodder for future iteration, these power dynamics and responses paint a picture of where we’ll be tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/28644/has-the-world-learned-the-lessons-of-the-2015-refugee-crisis&quot;&gt;Has the World Learned the Lessons of the 2015 Refugee Crisis?&lt;/a&gt;
Framed by the current coronavirus crisis, this article explores the collective action problem of mass migration and what we have apparently failed to learn in its systemic effects. As Dona Meadows demonstrates, while events may differ on the surface, their underlying systemic mechanics might actually be quite similar. I found this to be a useful read given how the European Union has been approaching the virus and its most affected member states, both to consider consistencies in response and in how this virus will multiply the strain already felt by the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/region&gt;&lt;security credit=&quot;Greg Barker&quot;&gt;&lt;span

Whereas China is taking the official stance that there are no active infections in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the US military is being both open and proactive in engaging with the threat. Unfortunately, the nature of military service is close proximity and frequent rotations, so it is inevitable that a substantive portion of the uniformed service of both countries will be infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way this virus is reshaping our security landscape and relative strength is important to watch. With the US military reeling from nearly two decades of war, the sudden reality that the homeland is no sanctuary may come as a lasting shock. By the same token, just as President Xi was dealt a major political blow when his administration failed to cover up the Wuhan outbreak, President Trump is facing the same for his unwillingness and inability to enact any meaningful preparation as the chief executive. With that, both leaders have now turned to blaming the others for what is effectively a risk that was inevitable: whether it emerged from a Chinese wet market, an American farm, a Brazilian forestry site, or an African mining operation. These cycles of blame and escalation are incredibly dangerous, and it’s these types of cycles and feedback loops which we need to watch as closely as the immediate effects of our current pandemic and economic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/security&gt;&lt;jobs&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block jobad&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;User Research in Ethiopia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum/design-gigs-for-good&amp;#x26;showsearch=true&amp;#x26;showpopout=true&amp;#x26;showtabs=false&amp;#x26;parenturl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.designgigsforgood.org%2Fjob-board#!topic/design-gigs-for-good/ssVm3KilpSA&quot;&gt;Contract User Researcher, Simple.org&lt;/a&gt;

The Danish Camp Adventure Observation Tower is an incredible structure and one that is standing disquietingly still right now. Architecture like this is all throughout Scandinavia: stark and meditative, it serves to take you out of place for a moment and — per the theme of this issue — helps you to reset. Somewhat. If you find yourself in Denmark and the quarantine has lifted, I encourage you to give it a visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/image&gt;&lt;voices who=&quot;Philippe Beaulieu-Brossard&quot; role=&quot;Co-Director, Archipelago of Design&quot; image=&quot;img/phillipe.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;span

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is design thinking impacting the special forces in the US, Denmark, and Canada? That was the context where I met Philippe, who was participating in a panel on Design Thinking in the Military. While I am a bit of a design thinking skeptic, this contemporary exploration of design practice by military theorists and practitioners is worth our attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philippe and his peers are creating a synthesis around modalities of thought, learning, and practice in the design high-autonomy teams and high-stake outcomes. His work and the work of his peers is helping me reframe my own understanding of design, so expect to see more of this type of thing shared in future issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Philippe’s words: “We use design thinking as an umbrella term to make things easier with military organizations. We dig more deeply into a philosophical and methodological assemblage including American pragmatism, system theory, design theory, strategic design, foresight, organization theory, complexity theory, post structuralism, and operational art to name a few.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://militaryepistemology.com/&quot;&gt;The Archipelago of Design: Reflexive Military Practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/voices&gt;&lt;twitter who=&quot;svg&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/svg/status/1244540212866400256&quot;&gt;Who led the digital transformation in your company? a) CEO b) CTO c) Covid 19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/twitter&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Global Pandemic Issue]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hello from a shuttered Denmark, This past week we’ve seen the “exponential” part of exponential growth hit the world like a tidal wave…]]></description><link>https://divergeweekly.com/2/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://divergeweekly.com/2/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2020 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;main credit=&quot;Edvard Munch&quot; quote=&quot;When someone is saved from certain death by a strange concatenation of circumstances, they say that&apos;s a miracle.

      /&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello from a shuttered Denmark,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past week we’ve seen the “exponential” part of exponential growth hit the world like a tidal wave. Markets have dipped, businesses are scrambling, and the people that constitute both are unsure of what’s coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we’ve seen with this global crisis is a failure in planning, and for those of us who are designers, planning is our business. At its core, &lt;strong&gt;Design is a time-delayed activity&lt;/strong&gt;: one where we engage with people and systems to plot out a path to a better future using artifacts and experiences. In this pandemic, we’re instead seeing a reversion. Far from having planned redundancies and designed for resiliency, we’re instead facing the stark fragility of a system co-designed with agents of unchecked growth and profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this definition of design, we have two key components: foresight and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foresight&lt;/strong&gt; asks: what is needed in the future? Why do we believe this? What needs to happen for that to exist? What else might happen?
On a systemic and world-spanning extreme, the peak of this practice is in world-building fiction. Books like &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2TR3O9Z&quot;&gt;Max Brooks’ World War Z&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/33jAs79&quot;&gt;Liu Cixin’s The Dark Forest&lt;/a&gt; both take a worldly and step-by-step approach to exploring human behaviour and outcomes given distinct conditions: for World War Z, a global zombie pandemic; and for the Dark Forest, an impending apocalypse and humanity’s instinct to flee, fight, or simply give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the nearer term, the designer has a host of tools available, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://nearfuturelaboratory.myshopify.com/products/design-fiction-product-design-work-kit&quot;&gt;card games like those created by Near Future Lab&lt;/a&gt; for generating scenarios, and structured “gap filling” tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249060842_Backcasting_-_A_framework_for_for_strategic_planning&quot;&gt;backcasting&lt;/a&gt; to map the pathway to the preferable outcomes. But at best, foresight samples and extrapolates from the potential territories that we march toward, and informs the context and constraints of our design activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other end is &lt;strong&gt;intervention&lt;/strong&gt;. With the current coronavirus outbreak, the rhetorical focus has very much been on POLICY interventions: how can we wield the apparatus of states to tackle a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action_problem&quot;&gt;collective action problem&lt;/a&gt; like a global pandemic? For examples of this discussion, &lt;a href=&quot;https://megaphone.link/VMP2383267901&quot;&gt;there’s a great episode of Vox’s The Weeds&lt;/a&gt; on the American policy response, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://megaphone.link/VMP2017093543&quot;&gt;Vox’s global affairs podcast Worldly has an additional North American-centric exploration of outcomes and implications as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we’re also seeing an active response in how design engages with the crisis. As Malcom McCullough points out in his book Digital Ground, “The success of a design is arrived at socially.” Across China —an already incredibly sophisticated and integrated surveillance state— software serves to mitigate, inform, but also surveil. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/business/china-coronavirus-surveillance.html&quot;&gt;Chinese public-private partnerships have led to a colour-code based access system to public space&lt;/a&gt;, with quite legitimate concerns for social acceptance of surveillance post-pandemic. A state’s over-reach might seem prudent in a crisis, but what provisions are in place to revert once the crisis has passed? &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Quinctius_Cincinnatus&quot;&gt;We don’t always get Cincinnatus&lt;/a&gt;, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea is taking a similar intervention with a different implementation — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/815441078/south-koreas-drive-through-testing-for-coronavirus-is-fast-and-free&quot;&gt;free drive through testing in your car with a simple text-message based notification of your results&lt;/a&gt; which allows testing infrastructure to be incredibly light weight in a country where two-thirds of people own a car. In other words, we are seeing “crisis architecture” churn through society once more: the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-building-1000-bed-hospital-over-the-weekend-to-treat-coronavirus&quot;&gt;modular hospitals in Wuhan&lt;/a&gt; being in the same family as &lt;a href=&quot;https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-32-design-for-airports/&quot;&gt;post-9/11 segmentation of America’s airports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, design has a role in this crisis, but how does the individual designer engage? The most useless thing I’ve read about the coronavirus was this &lt;a href=&quot;https://fortune.com/2020/01/28/the-coronavirus-problem-could-be-solved-by-design-thinking/&quot;&gt;list of how design thinking is going to save us from coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a “design thinker” only asking these questions now, you’ve already failed. The examples in China and South Korea are an adaptive strategy with an adaptive design to a fast moving crisis that came from either excellent foresight activities (taking a more strategic approach) or simply learning the hard way (the more intuitive approach). As such, the context for an appropriate design to emerge, succeed, and hopefully obviate its utility already exists, as we’re already seeing with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archpaper.com/2020/03/wuhan-shutters-all-temporary-hospitals-covid-19-risk-dissipates/&quot;&gt;1000 bed hospital in Wuhan being disassembled&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we collectively weather this pandemic, the thing we should recognize is that &lt;strong&gt;foresight without intervention is simply speculation, and intervention without foresight is &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22453746&quot;&gt;naive at best&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/12/814876173/coronavirus-trump-speech-creates-chaos-eu-says-it-wasnt-warned-of-travel-ban&quot;&gt;incredibly harmful at worst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. As those working in or adjacent to design, we have a responsibility to look ahead: both systematically using the tools of our trade, and ambiantly by absorbing information globally and from many sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be safe and by generous. Finally, look after yourself now, because like everyone’s favourite William Gibson quote, “The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/coronavirus-china-sends-medical-aid-to-spain-and-italy&quot;&gt;Just as China is finding itself able to respond to Italy’s needs&lt;/a&gt; because of how it handled its own spike in infections, we all might be in a position to help others depending on where we are in our own infection curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s it for this week. As always, I’d encourage you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://divergeweekly.com&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t and &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:alb@andrewlb.com&quot;&gt;send me a note&lt;/a&gt; if you have questions or feedback!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;&lt;region&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;Americas&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-the-next-plague-hits/561734/&quot;&gt;The Next Plague Is Coming. Is America Ready?&lt;/a&gt;
I found it valuable to revisit this article from 2018, when there were cries to learn from the risk inherent to the most recent Ebola outbreaks. There is no guarantee that we will learn from this crisis, and so we must do what we can to build a personal pattern-recognition for the leading signs and signals of our next crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;MENA&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/iran-coronavirus-outbreak-graves/&quot;&gt;Coronavirus burial pits so vast they’re visible from space&lt;/a&gt;
Already having faced incredible internal upheaval in January, Iran has been brutally affected by the coronavirus, evidenced by the digging of mass graves near Qom. The societal scars of poor foresight, maladapted systems, and just bad luck will be with us for decades; and Iran will be an important place to watch for social adaptation post-crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;East Asia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.centerforinnovation.mayo.edu/2012/02/16/health-care-design-in-singapore/&quot;&gt;Health Care + Design in Singapore&lt;/a&gt;
Singapore has been lauded has being particularly well adapted to coronavirus and previous pandemics (like SARS). In trying to learn a bit more about how this happened, I found this to be a useful look at how Singapore has approached the design of its healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;South Asia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-877&quot;&gt;Designing a handwashing station for infrastructure-restricted communities in Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;
This is an older article, but an interesting one to surface. The infrastructure of personal hygiene is always an issue in public health, and one which we readily take for granted. This article digs into the affordances and cues we need to keep in mind to adhere to protective hygiene in this era, and might be a useful tool for those of you thinking of setting something up for your community or building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;Europe&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dezeen.com/2020/03/09/li-edelkoort-coronavirus-reset/&quot;&gt;Coronavirus offers “a blank page for a new beginning” says Li Edelkoort&lt;/a&gt;
Dutch designer and forecaster Li Edelkoort weighs in on the possibility of an economic “reset” from coronavirus, especially with regards to globalization of certain local commodities (she uses the example of saris made in China and imported to India, which have disrupted local design markets).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/region&gt;&lt;security credit=&quot;Source Unknown&quot;&gt;&lt;span

I got a bit of a behind-the-scenes look during my time at New America, and can enthusiastically recommend the opportunity to work with Travis and his team.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cade Diehm is a designer and thinker based in Berlin, but travels around the world speaking on design through a lens of security, society, and critical theory. I was first introduced to his work a few years ago through his essay On Weaponized Design, but more recently have been excited to see what comes out of The New Design Congress. Give it a subscribe below: the first newsletter just came out last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://newdesigncongress.org/&quot;&gt;The New Design Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/voices&gt;&lt;twitter who=&quot;tomvanderbilt&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tomvanderbilt/status/1238524310035279878&quot;&gt;After decades of WFH, I’d need an article with tips on how to work in an office.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/twitter&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;classified&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of my adult life, my country (one of them anyway, being a dual citizen between the US and Canada) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2020/02/war-afghanistan-2001-invasion-2020-taliban-deal-200229142658305.html&quot;&gt;has been at war somewhere else in the world&lt;/a&gt;. But the experience of that war for American civilians was often ambiguous or bureaucratic, not tactile or kinetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the announced agreement between the Taliban and US has been a sign that this defining conflict is drawing to a close, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/04/on-afghanistan-give-peace-a-chance-but-be-wary-of-the-taliban/&quot;&gt;but many unknowns remain&lt;/a&gt;. Foremost amongst these concerns is how negotiations with the existing Afghan government will go (as they are not part of the US/Taliban negotiations). And the bigger question: what will happen to the rights and access that many Afghans have fought to establish amongst conflict, but outside of the Taliban’s day-to-day control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afghan women have particularly led these social changes, and have a lot to worry about with an unshackled Taliban. &lt;a href=&quot;https://giwps.georgetown.edu/a-new-generation-of-afghan-women-leaders/&quot;&gt;While impressive strides have been made in women’s leadership&lt;/a&gt;, it’s often overlooked that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amnesty.org.uk/womens-rights-afghanistan-history&quot;&gt;status of women in Afghanistan had been progressive&lt;/a&gt; prior to the Soviet-led coup in 1978. This event sparked the formation of an insurgent Mujihadeen and eventual rise of the Taliban in the 1990s, and with their rise, the persecution of and restrictions on women they enforced. A rehydrated Taliban power in Afghanistan might mean that much of what women have fought for in the past decades will be repressed again, and those women and men who have led that fight will face retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider this in the context of the impressive design work emerging from Afghanistan — both tangible product and services supporting people. I want to draw attention to &lt;a href=&quot;https://aquietrevolution.emergency.it/#/introduction&quot;&gt;The Anabah Maternity Center&lt;/a&gt; as a bright spot in how vital service delivery — in this case reproductive care — in Afghanistan is meeting both the health and cultural needs of those it serves. Originally created and supported by the Italian nonprofit Emergency, &lt;a href=&quot;https://brightthemag.com/health-women-maternity-afghanistan-security-da7a37b8e0bd&quot;&gt;the site has really grown into something led and operated by women serving the needs of their own community&lt;/a&gt;. In a country where the female working population is (and will be) recovering from years of repression, we can celebrate the design and implementation of a healthcare system led and staffed solely by women. They support other women who otherwise wouldn’t have any healthcare options because of patriarchal and religious barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good design doesn’t always come from those trained in design practices, but rather can emerge where a human centred disposition comes together with a systems-oriented mindset and an inclination to make something tangible. Design training and a tested process certainly facilitate and make repeatable that emergence, but as designers we can take a lot of inspiration from instances like Anabah: where its planners and operators performed great service design in the absence of a service designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s it for this week. As always, I’d encourage you to &lt;a href=&quot;https://divergeweekly.com&quot;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; if you haven’t and &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:alb@andrewlb.com&quot;&gt;send me a note&lt;/a&gt; if you have questions or feedback!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;&lt;region&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block region&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-heading&quot;&gt;Americas&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;custom-block-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811609241/coronavirus-fears-have-led-to-a-golden-age-of-hand-washing-psas&quot;&gt;Coronavirus Fears Have Led To A Golden Age Of Hand-Washing PSAs&lt;/a&gt;

Containing a pandemic is often a matter of surveillance and tracing connections between those affected.

Having been a product designer at the Pentagon myself, I can generally say that the state of military UX is pretty dismal EXCEPT for when it is mission critical. In a culture obsessed with Job Boyd’s OODA loop, speed and efficiency for warfighters is a strong argument. Seeing how that is playing out in other militaries, I wonder if UX will become yet another front in great power competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/security&gt;&lt;jobs&gt;&lt;!-- [[featurejob]]

Located in Turkey
Amnesty International is looking for a researcher to report on human rights issues in Turkey and the surrounding region. While this appears to be a more traditional research role, and less of a design-centric one, I think it could serve as a fascinating bridge for a design researcher to transition their values and viewpoint into the policy space. In particular, emphasizing empathy and qualitative methods in your application would go a long way!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/jobs&gt;&lt;sponsor image=&quot;https://www.knowsi.com/static/tier1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Knowsi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowsi manages consent for user research.

She’s a Bangladeshi-American service designer with experience working in education and NGOs around the world, including time spent in Palestine and Jordan.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the “preview” issue of Diverge Weekly, a weekly look at systemic design around the world. This is the first issue, the preview that was used for prototyping and testing the idea. You may not have gotten this in your inbox, but if you did, thank you for helping make this happen!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start, this newsletter is an investigation and roundup of the role that design might play in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, we’re seeing the global spread of COVID-19, or Corona virus, to the Middle East and beyond.New cases popping up in Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, Oman, Quatar, and around the world, cases in the Americas and Europe are causing alarm. Pandemics make visible much of what we believe and how we behave arounds systemic uncertainty, and often these behaviours manifest through artifacts tied to sickness. Face masks and hand sanitizer clipped to bags are two artifacts I’ve seen here in Copenhagen, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/2/6/21124979/wuhan-coronavirus-face-masks-hoarding&quot;&gt;though the former is perhaps more a totem than something with real utility&lt;/a&gt;. The real question is whether our focus on totems might &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-n95-face-masks.html&quot;&gt;serve to exacerbate the crisis if we hit a certain tipping point&lt;/a&gt;: yet another object designed for one catalyzing negative outcomes for many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the democratic presidential primaries are in full swing, with Senator Bernie Sanders emerging as a frontrunner with message focused around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/upshot/medicare-for-all-basics-bernie-sanders.html&quot;&gt;Medicare for All&lt;/a&gt;. For many of us who have experienced universal healthcare systems (in my case, Canada and Denmark), the discussion around a need for continued healthcare reform in the US is exciting and overdue. Good design and good experiences should not only be for the wealthy, and neither should good health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/idlib-battle-syria.html&quot;&gt;The ongoing battle for Idlib&lt;/a&gt; in Syria presents a less hopeful lens. Already a humanitarian disaster with countless refugees having fled to Idlib, the convergence of Russian-backed Pro-Assad forces and Turkish forces (both militia and actual military) has exacerbated their plight. From a design perspective, the ubiquitous UNHCR tent has been used &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TitusMichaeleus/status/1184867339331919872&quot;&gt;as cover by pro-Assad forces&lt;/a&gt; to disguise their forces against the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200301-turkey-destroys-scores-of-syrian-army-targets-incl-airport-air-defences-and-tanks/&quot;&gt;onslaught of Turkish airstrikes&lt;/a&gt;. The subversion of humanitarian objects for military maneuvers is nothing new, but given the humanitarian catastrophe using the symbols of the oppressed as cover is horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the prototype newsletter, so please &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:alb@andrewlb.com&quot;&gt;let us know what you think&lt;/a&gt; and I’m looking forward to building something you enjoy reading every week!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/main&gt;&lt;sponsor image=&quot;https://www.knowsi.com/static/tier1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Knowsi&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowsi manages consent for user research.

— Thomas Douglas, Founder of Canadian Universal Healthcare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello 👋,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Thank you for signing up!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Diverge Weekly, a newsletter looking at design and global affairs. Great services, purposeful architecture, incredible products, thoughtful interfaces: we want to help you make sense of what is happening around the world and empower you to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re busy and you’re already informed. You might be a &lt;strong&gt;UX researcher&lt;/strong&gt; fascinated by people, a &lt;strong&gt;design student&lt;/strong&gt; wondering when you can take your studio work to the world, or a &lt;strong&gt;product manager&lt;/strong&gt; juggling a dozen priorities. You might be a &lt;strong&gt;civil servant&lt;/strong&gt; at a government agency who is design curious, or &lt;strong&gt;serving in your country’s military&lt;/strong&gt; and looking for ways to think and problem solve divergently. There’s a lot going on though, so think of Diverge Weekly as a &lt;strong&gt;launching pad for developing your own global design literacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every week, we’ll take a look at what’s happening around the globe and where our current definitions of design — &lt;strong&gt;service, systemic, interaction, industrial, etc&lt;/strong&gt; — intersect and perhaps intervene in people’s lived experiences with world affairs. Sometimes we look at how design is failing us, like how a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dezeen.com/2017/12/18/dont-design-shelter-refugees-kilian-kleinschmidt-rene-boer-good-design-bad-world/&quot;&gt;myopic focus on one context for design interventions in refugee communities can blind us to better options&lt;/a&gt;. Other times, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/design-voices/instructed-to-fear-meeting-refugees-seeking-home-697017e3b125&quot;&gt;we’ll look to how designers go out of their way to surface others’ stories and change their own narrative in the process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We want to provide a gateway for designers to get involved in global design practice&lt;/strong&gt; by curating jobs, stories, and context with a lens to being critical about where design can play a role. In particular, we hope to identify opportunities where design has NOT traditionally had a seat (defence, global development, diplomacy), and work with our audience to infiltrate and have a design-led impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for joining and &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:hello@divergeweekly.com&quot;&gt;don’t hesitate to send us a note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you on Wednesday,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew&lt;/p&gt;
