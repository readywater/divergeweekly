Design\n          practice has a profound capacity to reveal the unseen and to affect\n          our behaviour, the systems we rely on, and the outcomes we\n          collectively experience. {title} aims to take a critical global\n          perspective in how design emerges from different localities, and how\n          our design decisions converge to impact and influence the lives of\n          those around the world.\n        </p>\n\n        <h1>Principles</h1>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            A focus on what Richard Buchanan refers to as the fourth order of\n            design in an international context. That said, we also believe that\n            design at this level only occurs when rooted in craft and practice.\n            As such, we will look for systemic and complexity-busting examples\n            of design in business and political systems, but also the design\n            practice that represents different localities, cultures, and\n            perspectives.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            This newsletter takes the perspective that we lose the thread on the\n            person centric nature of design if we anthropomorphize systems and\n            political constructs. To that end, we specifically focus on people\n            and collectives within regions, and try not to focus on the action\n            of a nation, but rather emphasize the actions and creations of an\n            administration, a person, or a business.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h1>Who writes this?</h1>\n        <p>\n          <a href=\"https://andrewlb.com\">Andrew Lovett-Barron</a> is a\n          Canadian/American dual citizen currently living in Denmark.
